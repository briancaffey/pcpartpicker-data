I have two computers in a home office hooked up to this UPS. One is an AMD 8-core system and the other is an Intel 4-core system. Both are gaming systems with high-end graphics cards and multiple hard drives. The AMD system has a 650-watt power supply and the Intel system has a 750-watt power supply. With both systems running I am at about 60 to 70 percent load. Living in FL we have multiple brown-outs a year and this UPS carries my systems through these without issue. ,5,UPS
"Great UPS.  Included software for Windows is old, but functional.  Also works very well with apcupsd on Ubuntu Server 16.04. My only gripe is that the persistent power light is VERY bright, plan on buying a roll of electrical tape to cover it up! Also worth noting that the load monitor on the UPS is not highly accurate (+/-10W at low loads), but it's good enough for a ballpark. ",5,UPS
"This is an amazing battery backup/UPS. It has 5 surge only outlets, 5 switched and backed up outlets plus a separate master plus 2 outlet protection for coax and 6p6c. The display on the front can be left on or turned completely off and has numerous settings for monitoring EVERYTHING related to your power you could want including total power draw and amount of backup power/time that can be output if the power were to go out. I have EVERYTHING hooked up to it in one way or another. It retails for $150 at Best Buy but I wouldn't even have it if it weren't given to me (brand new) by my neighbor. ",5,UPS
"Power outages and brownouts are fairly common where I live, and the wiring in my house is not great, hence why I decided to buy a UPS. This particular model is designed to work with active PFC power supplies (which is not supposed to strain the PSU when it goes into batter backup mode), which is why I chose to go with this one over some of the cheaper models that only offered simulated sine wave. It's already saved me from a few outages in the month that I've had it, so it's doing it's job pretty well, so far. My only gripe is that the software looks extremely outdated, but that's a small con. ",5,UPS
Pretty standard stuff here. ,4,UPS
"I believe this is the UPS that I have, it was bought a year ago for my laptop, no problems and is doing great. ",5,UPS
"I needed a UPS, this covers me unless I'm pushing the system to the max, otherwise it works and was a good price. ",4,UPS
"Use them at work as well. Battery will outlast the warranty. Replacements and upgrades are relatively inexpensive. The UPS market is pretty much locked down already anyway. EDIT: Died after 8 months. Got it replaced quickly and easily, but still I have a very poor taste in my mouth. No one puts baby in danger. No one. ",3,UPS
I've been using this to make sure that my NAS has close to 100% up time. ,5,UPS
