"A large piece but still gets the job done, and done well.  Only reason for the 4-star review is due to its size.  Almost thought it wouldn't fit in my case. ",4,CPU_cooler

"I gotta admit I'm kinda new to all this PC building and now I can really tell this was not necessary, but I did hear that these aftermarket CPU coolers are SUPER quiet compared to stock, so I'll give it that! CPU on idle about 18-22, on load about 45-48. ",5,CPU_cooler
Decent cooler for the price. Performs better than stock while making less noise. I think this should be considered the stock cooler IMO.  ,4,CPU_cooler
"Works, easy install, not too big and didn't block my ram. ",5,CPU_cooler
Great liquid cooler but its no dual core radiator. Single core packs a punch for what it offers. I am running a 4790k with a 4.6 overclock and it runs from 25 idle to 70-72 on full load.  ,5,CPU_cooler
"Easy to put together, silent, and it works perfectly for cooling down my i5-4690K. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Another bang for your buck, easily beats any corsair and other competing brands not just in cost but also in performance. £67 for a 38.5mm thick rad, and three fans. Keeps my cpu 20-25 idle and max of 45-55'c in games ",5,CPU_cooler
I’ve had Noctua case fans from the start of this build. With that the CPU cooler was noticeably noisy when trying to game quietly. I decided to acquire another Noctua fan for the CPU when I upgraded it. This thing is almost silent. ,5,CPU_cooler
"Very quiet most of the times but a mild roar at load, for those trans-coding video overnight in their bedroom, it's too loud. The LED lights are cool however and it's cheap. As to how well this would cool an overclocked i5 and i7, there are reviews out there, but I don't have any personal experience  ",4,CPU_cooler
"This is an aggressively priced 240mm AIO CPU cooler. As of right now you can pick one up for about $80. It comes with 4 fans intended for push-pull config, the ARCTIC F12 PWMs, which can be daisy-chained so they only require a single 4-pin fan socket. I knocked off one star because anywhere above 40% RPM and they're louder than I would have preferred. Not jet-engine loud, just noticeable. They're still quieter than the GPU when it revs up, and at 20% they're practically inaudible in the average home. I've seen a couple of review sites knock it for it's minimal packaging; this is actually intentional. ARCTIC is a carbon-neutral company and part of that was strategically reducing excessive packaging. Just wanted to clarify this because I think it's an ignorant complaint. ",4,CPU_cooler
"A topflow cpu cooler is mandatory if air cooling in SG13.
I wanted a really low profile one to keep an optimum clearance with the PSU which be positionned above. Plus the fan on this cooler can be flipped to send the hot air right in the PSU (if reversed) allowing a configuration where the hot air would be exhausted by the PSU.
Air cooling in SG13 is the challenge here and the AR05 meets the expectations, keeping my i3 6100 on very good temps but also very quietly! Perfect in my configuration. ",5,CPU_cooler
if you are on a tight budget I would say just get a EVO and get it over with. ,4,CPU_cooler
Excellent cooler. Using it on the Xeon E5-2690 V4 and it runs very cool at low RPMs. ,5,CPU_cooler
Keeps my CPU nice and cool in mid-30 C's. ,5,CPU_cooler
"Keeps my c2d at decent temps, could be cooler, could be WAY more silent, but overall, pretty decent for the price. ",3,CPU_cooler
"It's very quiet and performs extremely well. It beats out single 120mm radiators in benchmarks. For the looks, I think any Noctua product brings premium look to your computer and as I don't have window in my case I don't really care what it looks like. Only downside is that with my motherboard, the cooler blocks the first PCI-e slot, but as I have 2 of them so it's not really a big deal. There is a list on Noctuas website where they will tell if your motherboard has any problems with the cooler.  ",5,CPU_cooler
My first aftermarket CPU cooler and its a beast! Keeps my OC Phenom II cool! Plus the fans aren't even maxed haha! Fan speed is around 30/40%. ,5,CPU_cooler
"I couldn't get the famous 212 EVO and it took me a while to settle on alternative. So far I am impressed. While Scythe Mugen 4 won't break any records in idle temps (low-mid 30s, but ambient is pretty high here), under load it performs great. The CPU never passed 60C while running prime95 and in its 40s under  normal every day load including gaming. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Keeps my i5 4690k Cool while playing Assassin's Creed Unity at Ultra settings, and while rendering videos and the like.  Max CPu temp hits 75 or 77 but that is really overloaded.  Normal use is fine at 50-60. Fits nicely in my Mini ITX.
See my build video log here
 ",4,CPU_cooler
"Too big, can't fit GPU at first PCIe on a ATX motherboard. Won't be able to SLI with this cooler. ",3,CPU_cooler
"Nice looking cooler, the fan on top of the CPU assembly looks terrific and as I mentioned before in the CPU section, It does the job with a temperature span of 25 Deg at Idle and around 60 Deg during 100% usage.  One thing, the radiator is way too thick compared to the other AIO coolers in the market, so If you want your radiator to go on the top of your build make sure you have enough room for it and that it does not interfere with the rams, mine does, and that is why it is installed in front, sacrificing all of my 3.5in drive bays. ",4,CPU_cooler
Excellent! Will never use another brand CPU cooler for a high end air solution! Small but powerful! ,5,CPU_cooler
This cooler is super quiet.   Haven't gotten into OCing anything yet.   But so far very good.   ,5,CPU_cooler
I mostly bought this based on looks but I was very surprised at how well it performs. I was only able to fit one fan for a pull config but it still keeps temps much cooler than my other cooler master 120v AIO ,5,CPU_cooler
"Great starter for a heat sink, but eventually it make some noises.  ",3,CPU_cooler
"Awesome CPU cooler! Keeps the CPU cool and the new pump looks great. Idle CPU temp
22'c - 25'c  Load temps 44'c - 50'c  Stable 4.6 ghtz overclock. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Fans aren't the quietest but its def good value and looks good.
ONLY WISH SOMEONE SAID IT HAS A PULSING LED?  Annoying - I wish it was on constantly. also beware of the height of the heatsink as the ""visual"" tube hit the fans on my ITX case until I got a new mobo and could install on a different rotation. ",4,CPU_cooler
"A great low profile CPU cooler for builds with tight spaces, I'm not 100% sure the orange LED fan I added will be up to the challenge of the really small fins on it but I'll test to be sure :)  In the second to last photo I show the brackets going left-right, I hit the wifi module when I tried to place this so ended up going up/down instead.  ",5,CPU_cooler
"Pretty cheap, works well, and I'm having no issues with my 4690k at 4.2 GHz ",5,CPU_cooler
"Incredible AIO cooler. Very good build quality, easy to mount, good quality fans, great performance. The radiator is thicker than most AIO coolers (45mm). This won't be a problem in most cases, but if you are tight on space realize that you may not be able to mount both fans in push-pull. The pump is silent and the fans run very quietly, even at full load. Be careful when mounting if only using one fan. The length of the screws means that you can't attach the radiator directly to your case without pushing your screws entirely through the radiator. There is nothing stopping you from doing so and the fins are thin enough that you won't notice while screwing it in. If you would like to attach it directly you will need to purchase much shorter screws or accept the (hopefully minimal) performance impact of screwing right through the radiator. The only change I would make is adding a copper radiator as opposed to aluminum. Some users might also hope for heat pipes that bend where they connect to the CPU block (in the same way as most Corsair and Cooler Master products), but their softness seems to make up for it and they had no trouble squeezing into my case (though I am using an SFX power supply). In the Sugo SG13 I'm using one fan pulling air from the front of the case and pushing it through the radiator into the CPU area. Was worried that using only one fan would hurt performance, but it doesn't seem to have affected the heat much. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Included fan is high quality and nearly silent at low RPMs, keeps an 80W chip cool without making lots of noise.  Great value if you can find one for $40 or less shipped. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Great CPU cooler. Very big, despite the name ""slim"". ",4,CPU_cooler
"Ah the classic Hyper 212 Evo, now with red LEDS! 'Nuff said. ",5,CPU_cooler
Thanks to the be quiet! Silent Loop 280 my CPU stays at 30°C idle and 70°C during max heat test in prime 95. Fans and pump speed are set manually to turn max speed at 70°C. It's quiet AF while gaming. The pump runs at 60% speed all the time - dead silent. ,5,CPU_cooler
"Noctua is known worldwide as the go-to brand for their quality quiet fans, and they do not disappoint with these coolers. The coolers are as compact as you would want for a vertical tower cooler, however, they run silent and perform excellently.  ",5,CPU_cooler
"This AIO is easy to put together, performs well, is not too big and comes in a variety of colors. ",4,CPU_cooler
The Deepcool GAMMAXX 300 was listed in the other system build but never arrived from Newegg. They refunded it and I was able to get that computer cooler through other means. I did order it for this system because I was curious about its performance and it didn't disappoint. The 400 would have kept it cooler but apparently wouldn't have fit in the case. This cooler is a tad loud when the CPU gets hotter but I rarely notice since I'm usually in game. ,4,CPU_cooler
"It's ok. Nice and quiet, and decent build quality. Cooling performance will always be limited at this size/ff. Does well for itself but should be a little cheaper imo. ",3,CPU_cooler
"Another old part, I've had this on my the i5 for its entire life. I can't compare its performance to anything else, but I assume it's pretty average. in this new case the CPU idles around the mid 30's and operates around 50 degrees on a gaming load. Good enough. It has been running for almost four years now, and the only downside is that the pump can sometimes be a bit noisy. ",4,CPU_cooler
"Does its job well enough.  I didn't bother replacing the pre-applied thermal paste with anything better because I was lazy.  Doesn't seem to be hurting it (yet?), though.  I paid about double what it costs on Amazon because I was certain that it was discontinued, with it being out of stock everywhere online in North America that I could find at the time I ordered it, so I ordered one on eBay that shipped from Germany.  Then it showed up back in stock on Amazon in mid-December and I kicked myself.  I still say it's worth it compared to the stock cooler, though. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Even though I already knew how to install it, the installation instructions were terrible. The software was terrible. I could not even change the colour of the pump LED. Luckily, NZXT had just posted a beta of their next software to  And, the pump is already making noises. I can hear it grinding from across the room in bed. ",2,CPU_cooler
"Annoying installation, Great silent cooling ",4,CPU_cooler
the only compatible air cooler. this is more silent than silence itself ,5,CPU_cooler
"Cons? Can't find many, it is my first ever AIO watercooler and I am really satisfied with it. Previously I have used only Noctua coolers so I think it says it's a good quality product. ",5,CPU_cooler
No complaints so far. Does its job well and keeps my CPU temperature around 30-35 C at idle and I have not seen It get hotter than 70 under heavy load while overclocked.  ,5,CPU_cooler
"To paraphrase the  To be honest, I picked this out rather dumbly.  I did a search for best-rated coolers with a very quiet fan (that weren't water-based), and this kept turning up, so I grabbed it.  I didn't really understand how zarking  They tried to be nice and included a long-shaft screwdriver for attaching the towers to the mounting bracket.  However, in practice, it's only slightly better than the hex drivers included with Ikea furniture -- it's very tricky overcoming the spring compression and getting the screws to finally grab on to the posts. The cables from the fans are a bit on the short side, with one of them just barely making it to the second CPU fan header.  I tried rotating how the fan was mounted, but you can't remove the brackets from the fans without possibly breaking something. ",4,CPU_cooler
"The Thermalright (that's 'right', not 'take') Macho B CPU cooler has worked out well. I painted the fan blades and heat sink fins red. Also added the duct to connect the airflow to the exhaust fan. Much cooler and quieter than my old 92mm cooler. ",5,CPU_cooler
Adjustable fan speeds and liquid cooling at a cost-effective price... awesome. The new H80i must be epic to be able to control via USB and software... but I'm still happy with the manually controlled one. :) ,5,CPU_cooler
Looks fantastic! Software that comes with it is nice to have! Performs great. Fans that are included you will want to swap out for ones that are less loud.  ,5,CPU_cooler
"It looks sexy, and cools pretty good, and is quiet when its not set to full RPM, its a little noisy at RPM but nothing that bothers me or I really even notice when I play a game, not much else I can say here. ",5,CPU_cooler
"For an entry-level AIO cooler, it worked perfectly for my rig. Quickly brings down my CPU temp and you can barely hear it unless it kicks to 75~100% RPM. ",4,CPU_cooler
Happy with it because it not leaking yet. ,5,CPU_cooler
"For a cheap cooler, it managed to OC my CPU to a stable 4.2. ",4,CPU_cooler
"I did have a look but couldn't find many other people using this on there build but I liked the look of it and for £16 I thought I probably couldn't go wrong! In the future I might look to upgrade the CPU, overclock and go down the water cooler route but for now this seems to be keeping my temps down! It's a little bit of a faff to fit as the backing plate doesn't screw directly to the motherboard and you have to do a bit of balancing to get everything to fit! This comes with all necessary fittings, a small tube of paste etc. and for the money it seems to be doing a fairly good job! I am not a gamer so can't comment on temps when under heavy load but so far I haven't seen temps over 45 degrees when editing and playing videos. Personally i think it's a good looking bit of kit, it's very quiet and seems to be well made. The kit does come with spare clips and rubber strips so a second fan can be fitted to exhaust out the back for better cooling. There is no interference with RAM and the cooler is fairly short so would fit in a much smaller case. ",4,CPU_cooler
"Great cooler but you'll need a reference or water cooled car, my situation had me sucking up the hot GPU air and it made my CPU temps as high as 75C while just playing the witcher 3 ",4,CPU_cooler
"Only had this for a few months on another PC which I upgraded to a K skew CPU & upgraded its cooler at the same time.
This keeps the 3470 under 30 degrees at idle and between 40-50 degrees under load.  ",4,CPU_cooler
Keeps the 4690k cool while ocing.  Looks good.  Easy install. ,5,CPU_cooler
"I run at full speed all the time and is super quiet, and it's got good looks. ",4,CPU_cooler
"Great little cooler. Installed in Thermaltake Core V1 without a problem. Keeps my 7850K super cool. I wish I recorded temps before installing, but my thermal margin is 70C at idle and 52C under load. BIOS reports temp at 26C (not thermal margin, but actual temp). These temps are at 20C ambient room temperature. The LNC this cooler comes with makes a huge difference in noise reduction. Don't forget to use it. UPDATE: After five months with this cooler my temps are constantly jumping up and down by 10C. Coil whine from pump. Random knocking sounds, air bubble noise. BIOS reports actual temp at 40C. Thermal margin reported by AMD Overdrive jumping every second from 60C to 70C. I did a clean OS install thinking it was a software issue. Still the same results. ",1,CPU_cooler
"Bought mainly for looks, and while its quiet, temps are average. Mounting is solid and a overall a good purchase if its on sale. ",4,CPU_cooler
keeps my cpu at a frost bitten 25c. Rose to 35c under full load for around 2 hours. ,5,CPU_cooler
Not a bad cooler to say how old it is. A major pain in the arse to fit unless you take the motherboard out of the case. Easy to install the wrong way. Nice red LED's compliment my build. ,3,CPU_cooler
very surprised by this cooler. It tamed my a10-5800k toaster and keeps my new 10-7870k at 24c on idle and 31c after a couple hours gaming. ,5,CPU_cooler
"Very good cooler. Was able to overclock my i5-6600k to 4.8GHz with this cooler. Kinda loud at full speed but I've only noticed it go to full speed during heavy benchmarks, for normal use it stays pretty quiet. ",5,CPU_cooler
Serves its purpose quite well. For the price it is actually one of the best one in its segment. ,4,CPU_cooler
"I love this CPU fan!!! Very quiet and sexy, but the installation was a nightmare!!! Took me 2 hours, 2 people and building some ungodly contraptions to get it on there, as the case I was using was quite big and I'm a small person. Once it was on there it was on there though and it works as i expected it would!!! ",4,CPU_cooler
"I got the nepton for a really low price, it was a steal for how well it performs, a lot quieter than I expected! I  wish the tubes were more flexible and that I could take off the bright yellow label on the pump-motherboard connector without voiding my warranty but aside from those relatively minor things it's great ",4,CPU_cooler
"Super cool, and quiet. Fans are Good but not the best. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Extremely quiet, even @ 100%. Big heatsink = no need to ramp up the fan. I recommended. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Works well, Corsair Link interface is simple and snap to install. I'll post some test temps soon. ",5,CPU_cooler
"I have had no leaks, but sometimes I hear a little air noise in there.
Other than the little air noise I hear when I open my case it is very quiet.  ",4,CPU_cooler
"OK OK OK. This cooler gave me HELL throughout my entire build. It was hard to install and it didn't feel practical. Although from the hate I have for it, I do admit that it can cool your CPU very well. If you can deal with an annoying build process, then it can be worth your time looking at it. Planning on getting an All in One cooler to replace it. ",2,CPU_cooler
"Color me surprised to find an air cooler that was able to keep at least a 5820K at stock at no more than 42C, as well as packign the mounting hardware needed so I could even slap it on an LGA775 CPU later. Even came with some mounting stuff to dampen vibrations for two fans for a push-pull setup. Thankfully, just manages to not interfere with the 4-stick RAM setup on my X99 motherboard, so props for that. ",5,CPU_cooler
Still wasn't ready for Liquid cool. The fans are changeable as well. It even has a fan controller  which can get pretty loud at MAX.  ,5,CPU_cooler
"I like this water cooler unit for the fact it is easy to install, it is cheap and it has a pulsing white face on the cooler. It also works and the deepcool fan is pretty grunty. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Great cooler for an amazing price. Only complaint is that my motherboard can't control the fan speed, although the low noise headers work well. ",5,CPU_cooler
"This processor cools a FX 9590 as well, if not better than, liquid cooling.... I think that says enough. This CPU cooler is huge but that was not a problem as I have a big case. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Exceptional AIO cooling, but noisey fans come standard. ",5,CPU_cooler
Great AIO iquid Cooler for cheap. Wouldn't pay more then $55 for it.. ,5,CPU_cooler
"I love this product, even when I made the mistake of leaving the sticker on my heatsink and placing it over the CPU with the thermal paste, I would get temps of 100C before it would reach 100% but if it wasn't for this Phanteks cooler my CPU would have melted. Plus it never makes noise. It's rig is under my table and I can't hear the fans. ",5,CPU_cooler
"MAKE SURE YOU READ THIS. Only order this CPU cooler if you have an CPU_OPT or a CPU_FAN2 port on your motherboard. Unlike Corsairs header where it makes all the voltage run through the CPU_FAN port, Deepcool decided to be smart and not overload the port. The two fans run off a controller that plug into the optional port, and the pump itself runs with the CPU fan port. The cooler is fantastic for the price, you can get it on Newegg for $90, I'm not sure why partpicker doesn't show that, but it keeps my CPU well under 30 degrees Celsius but high enough to avoid condensation. Works very well under pressure and I've been able to game for hours and it's able to keep it under control. Highly recommended!  ",5,CPU_cooler
"Works great, improvement over stock cooler (I'm currently not overclocking). But minus 1 star because the screws (metric M3-.50's) it comes with are way too short, I went out and bought replacements that were longer and worked great, with a few threads exposed after fastening. I used M3-.50 x 10 long screws. I also mounted the fan exhausting out the back of my case, and still could use the silver spring-bracket in the vertical orientation by putting it through the heat sink pipes.
I do recommend this cooler as a descent enough, budget-friendly option. ",4,CPU_cooler
,4,CPU_cooler
"It get the job done, at least ",3,CPU_cooler
"Pros: Very very cheap, looks badass, quiet, easy to install. Cons: Copper dissipation, ****** pre-applied thermal paste. ",4,CPU_cooler
"Nice and quiet, keeps my locked CPU cool.  I wouldn't recommend this cooler for an unlocked or overclocked processor ",4,CPU_cooler
"It keeps the CPU cool, and the cooler is very quiet, but it is VERY HARD to get on the cooler.. ",3,CPU_cooler
"A space saving liquid cooler without compromising the cooling abilities with a huge, thick 120mm radiator and two 120mm fans. The bad side is, Under load is abit noisy for me ",4,CPU_cooler
"My CPU is overclocked to 4.5GHz @ 1.37V and the temps never went above 75C (ambient of 18C) under Prime95 and Cinebench stress testing. What was really amazing was that the temp quickly dropped back to ambient in less than 5 seconds after the completion of the stress testing. Not only that, the thing was quiet even when the fans were running at 1400RPM under stress testing. There is a minor whine from the pump tho, and that is fixed by using the BIOS to bring the pump down from 2500RPM to about 1700RPM. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Computer is now silent thanks to this puppy. Great, inexpensive cooler and can handle an overclock! ",4,CPU_cooler
"Plenty of airflow and keeps my CPU cool as a cucumber even at it's lowest RPM. Love the blue LED on it and the fan controller is pretty neat. I hooked it up to the back of my case and put the wires in the watercooling port, looks fancy imo. This thing is LOUD, though! (Unless you keep it at the lowest setting, which I do) And I've cut my hands up on it quite a few times just bumping it. It's also pretty bulky. ",4,CPU_cooler
"This was a weird, but specific choice.  One of my goals was to make sure this was a very quiet system.  I thought long and hard about water cooling, especially a fully sealed AIO system.  But, there's not a real performance or less noise-based benefit so I ultimately settled on the giant radiator/fan.  It seems Thermalright is mostly marketed in Europe, so they don't seem to be well known in the US.  However, the design competes with the Be Quiet! Dark Rock, Noctua and other more expensive models.  I should be able to overclock well with the cooling this provides.  Unfortunately, the width of the Macho X2 required me to remove the essentially redundant rear case fan.  Temps are low.  FPS are high. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Cheap, small, and keeps my overclocked 6600K very cool.  I've overclocked it to 4.2GHz,  and it still barely gets above 50*C. ",5,CPU_cooler
"It's a cooler, what can I say? ",4,CPU_cooler
Best top-down cooler that I can fit into my mini-ITX case ,5,CPU_cooler
"The aesthetics of this cooler is by far the best out there. Sturdy plastic construction, very flexible tubing, very high quality Deepcool fans as usual and solid quality radiator. However the fittings connecting the tubes to the water block is not the safest from potential leaks. The acrylic tubing seems to be fitted on using glue. Cooling performance is decent, as it beats most top down 92-120mm ITX coolers. However not as good when compared to tower heatsinks with single/dual/triple 120mm/140mm coolers. ",4,CPU_cooler
"Was new in the market at time of purchase, I have had it for almost 2 years now with no problems, although I do believe it gets hotter than its competitors like corsair and such, and to top things off they release a cooler and overall better design  mere weeks after I bought it... ",5,CPU_cooler
"Outstanding AIO cooler, one of the best around. ",5,CPU_cooler
I am legitimately amazed how cool this thing keeps my CPU. It's not only effective but it's quieter than my case fan.  ,5,CPU_cooler
"First time using a water cooler. The H90 provides serious overkill for my use; however, holiday sales at the time made the extra price negligible. The supplied instructions were terrible — I had to watch a couple online videos to ensure that I was installing it correctly. Other than that though, this cooler is fantastic. The design is stylish and the tubes are easy to maneuver. The pre-applied thermal compound was a nice touch. This thing is scarily quiet and keeps my CPU nice and cool. ",4,CPU_cooler
"I bought this when E-Buyer had a clearance event on with 20% off so I grabbed it for just £32, plus delivery. I bought it as an older double radiator cooler wouldn't fit in my mid-tower and I have to say I have been impressed every step of the way. The mounting bracket I recieved is dual purpose AMD and Intel, full metal on the backplate and the waterblock mounts. Came with stock thermal paste however I cleaned that and applied my own. Keeps my i5-4690K at 28-30C idle and 78-80C under load at 4.3Ghz with push-pull fans as intake, and that is with cheaper fans. When I upgrade I may be able to squeeze the CPU to 4.4Ghz. The cooling block also has a breathing LED Deepcool logo, which is a nice touch, and the water pipes are very flexible, but sturdy. For the price, this cooler cannot be praised enough. ",5,CPU_cooler
While this one was very tricky to set up it payed off my CPU is extremely cool when under load and the fan keeps my other components about 10 degrees cooler while still being extremely quiet. ,5,CPU_cooler
"My first experience with liquid cooling, so nothing to compare it to. Mostly bought it due to aesthetics and low price for a 240mm set up. Installation was really easy and straightforward. Keeps the processor (i5-6500) really cool 23-25C on idle, around 30C on general use and pushes up to 40 on heavy load. The fans are generally quite.
Downside the tubing is really stiff and can be difficult to get the right position, does not like much bend on them. If you want flexibility avoid plastic tubing and go for rubber ones. ",4,CPU_cooler
"Great cooler, hard to mount but worth it for the aesthetics, how cool it keeps the CPU, and quiet ",4,CPU_cooler
"Great cooler for anyone that wants to get into liquid cooling. 
This is an open loop that comes pre-filled and ready to install, you can leave
it like it is or expand to cool GPU or chipset. 
  Comes with fan controller but did not come with the three liquids stated in add. 
Best looking mounting plate I have seen as well as the easiest to install.   ",5,CPU_cooler
"Exceeded expectations, an absolute wonder! ",5,CPU_cooler
"Perfect for a build like this, wouldnt use on a gaming system or one your going to OC but something like this it works great and looks cool. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Pros: So far it has fit in my Azza sirius ATX mid tower case and sounds beautiful way better than the stock fan. Installation wasn't too bad at all, just had to deal with a little amount of room. Keeps the CPU nice and cool. Cons: none ",5,CPU_cooler
It is probably one of the best SFF coolers. However the mounting brackets are not perfect. It mounts easily on LGA2011(-3) however the LGA115* mounting kit is horrible. You have to be very patient and calm persona! ,4,CPU_cooler
"Installation is a breeze, Performance is jaw dropping in comparison to  a CoolerMaster Hyper 212 Evo, which could only maintain a 4.6 Ghz Oc speed on the FX 8350. The LED pump housing a clear tube is a very nice addition behind the tinted side panel of case.  With this cooler the AMD FX 8350 is running 4.8 Ghz on a 24/7 Over clock. ",5,CPU_cooler
This thing is pretty great once installed. I saw it recommended on  One I got it init works great. It's very quiet and run cool. I have the fan running at the quietest mode and the processor cores stay well under 70C usually under 50C. The price is right and it's quiet. ,4,CPU_cooler
"(UPGRADED)
I'm using this with a Noctua A15, which is a great combination. My CPU cooling solution is a self proposed cooling system for an effective yet low profile upgrade to a stock cooler, while still only being an air cooler. Running Prime95 for maximum heat I hit only 61C. Normal use heavy load (including gaming) is a top of only 55C. ",5,CPU_cooler
"a good fan speed for this at idle is 1,080ish and the CPU runs 32c or 89.6F after Asus EZ overclock settings under lode add 300RPM to it. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Never heard of the brand or the cooler itself before but it keeps the CPU very nicely cooler, the previous owner had the CPU (i5 4690k) OC'd to 4.5 with no issues. My only gripe is that its rather bulky so kind of hard to work with. ",4,CPU_cooler
Next best thing to no cooler at all ,3,CPU_cooler
"This thing is huge, keep that in mind if using for an mATX build.  Seems to be cooling nicely though was only able to get a 45x ratio on i7-6700k instead of 46x. ",4,CPU_cooler
"Great temperatures, one of the crews for mounting the block required most of my body weight in order to thread, longer posts would be nice so that i wouldnt have to flex my MOBO just to get it to thread. ",4,CPU_cooler
"THIS IS LOUD VERY VERY LOUD!!! It also knocked my 6600k at full load down 10c I've peaked out at 51c overclocked full load. Oh and on a side note it's big, big enough to cover the inner most ram slot... But it keeps things cool and looks great plus i grabbed it up from ebay for $30 bucks. ",4,CPU_cooler
"Its a Great looking cooler and it keeps the CPU cool. That is about the only thing I like about it, far bigger than I imagined it would be (yes i know i should have checked the size) and its very noisy even at idle.  ",2,CPU_cooler
Solid CPU fan for LGA 1151 and is quiet ,5,CPU_cooler
"Idk, I cant really tell if this is better then the stock cooler or not because I never tried it out with the stock cooler. 50 degrees Celsius idle, could be better. ",4,CPU_cooler
Fantastic 120mm cooler. Very quiet. ,5,CPU_cooler
"It is a so so fan. If you must use a low profile cooling solution which my case forced me to do, you can use this if you do not want to spend a lot of money. However, for anything that is 95W TDP or more, this may prove inadequate. My opinion is it should be good for 65W and lower.  ",3,CPU_cooler
"i really like how small this cooler is, ram clearance is astonishing and its small enough to fit in most cases. during long game sessions my CPU tends to get a bit hot but the cooler does its job ",4,CPU_cooler
"This thing is great.  It keeps the CPU cool, isn't too loud and just does it's job without any problems.  I plan on upgrading to the h100 if I grab a new case but only due to the need to want to get this thing as cold as ice.  Setup was pretty easy (Once I stopped ignoring the fan directions).  Loved that it comes with plates from both AMD and Intel so that I can throw this on something else if the need arises. ",5,CPU_cooler
"good quality aio, but i can not change the pump speed and it constantly runs at 3500rpm and is very loud... it was also a pain to install, but besides all that, it looks great and my cpu idles at 27c. ",4,CPU_cooler
"Runs more quiet than I expected. Difficult to mount, like most CPU fans. Very satisfied. ",4,CPU_cooler
"Looks stunning, runs super quiet and no ram clearance issues on mini itx. I think the Noctua colors are nice and the whole product is very good quality. this cooler is really designed to function. I would buy another and recommend this cooler to anyone. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Works well with this CPU but is a pain to install. I love the black finish, but they also sell a white one which looks great too. ",4,CPU_cooler
"This is a good cooler. Was able to keep it under 60 C under load at 4.5 Ghz. It seems to be lesser known than the 212 Evo, but it still works well. ",4,CPU_cooler
"The Be Quiet CPU cooler does a great job of keeping the i3-6100 at under 60C under load while spinning at 40%, where it is pretty much silent. The i3-6100 doesn't generate much heat and the stock cooler is completely fine for it. However, I wanted something with better acoustics. At idle, I have this CPU cooler spinning at around 10% and temps are 30C :)  ",5,CPU_cooler
"This cooler is one massive  beast!   My case is 7 1/2"" wide and I was left with 1/8"" clearance.  I measured six times before I took the plunge.  Didn't feel as heavy as I thought it would.  Invest in a long screwdriver.  This cooler is about 6 1/2"" tall. Performance is amazing! Worth every penny!  For those that don't want to get into liquid cooling, this cooler is outstanding!!  Would definitely recommend it.   ",5,CPU_cooler
"I am pretty disappointed in this cooler. Now it works  great, I have my G3258 at 4.4GHz with a max temp of 70C. But getting it there was not fun. The finish on the bottom of the heat sink is god awful. I didn't really notice it until I looked at the stock Intel cooler. The finish on the contact pipes is very grainy and it requires a good amount of thermal paste to compensate, which we all know is not a good solution. Also the AMD style clip doesn't apply anywhere near enough pressure. So I just shoved some paper in where the clip clamps down and now it applies plenty of force, I can barely get the thing clamped in. For the bottom I polished it with Blue Magic metal polish numerous times and then cleaned it with isopropyl to get rid of the silicone film left on it. My extra efforts took off ~10-15C from when it came out of the box, and I'm proud of that.  Of course I could have just returned it. TL;DR: Contact pipes have an awful finish and the clip doesn't apply enough force, but it's correctable.  ",3,CPU_cooler
"As I see no reviews for this item here goes...
A very very neat small radiator with a 120mm (their own silent edition) fan either side and a water block/pump that is a piano black with white logo that looks very sleek in place.
I do not overclock my CPU but it looks a lot neater than the standard intel fan and runs about 10 degrees C cooler both at idle and under gaming load. It is also a lot quieter than the standard fan.
Pro's...
Fill ports at both the radiator and CPU block for the occasional top up.
Anti kink tubes with swivelling angle connections for an easy install.
All in one solution that comes fully assembled and filled, just attach fans.
cons...
Quite a fat radiator/fan assembly may restrict some but my Define R4 midi case offered a few options, smaller cases may prove a problem.
Little documentation or instruction for installation for a first timer like myself. Installation tip...
Mount the radiator so that the tube connections are preferably at the bottom, or the sides and not on top as suited my build but gave temps over 10 degree's higher than a stock fan! I would imagine any small amount of air will find it's way there and prevent the pump working properly. ",4,CPU_cooler
doesn't cool enough i needed to change it to a liquid cooler it was really hard to install and its really big it barely fit my case it was pretty ugly and bad ,1,CPU_cooler
"For everyone who says this cooler is to loud or doesn't cool efficiently, they are wrong. I have a AMD 8350 and naturally it runs hot(very hot). With this cooler i have yet to get it above 50c. It doesn't run loud either, i use the stock fans and it isn't loud at all. I love this cooler and if you are hearing it inst worth it, to loud and stuff but you still want to buy it, do it. It is worth it ",5,CPU_cooler
Much better than the stock cooler. It dropped my cpu idle temps by 10C and my load temps by 20C. ,5,CPU_cooler
"The CPU cooler was originally bought for a mini-ITX build when I later changed my mind. Works well and it hums reassuringly. Goes up to 4.4GHz overclock at 82 degrees, but decided to play it safe and stuck with 4.2GHz. ",4,CPU_cooler
"I had always wanted to liquid cool. And the sheer silence you hear after you install it is amazing. It cools like a Champ, the CHAMP....JOHN CENA!!!!!!! No, no....no John Cena. No mas John Cena. ",4,CPU_cooler
I think this is the best cooler under 50 dollars. Keeps my cpu really cool and is also really quiet. ,5,CPU_cooler
Looks good but can't be run at full speed. Its loud and rattles. Maybe you could fab it up ,3,CPU_cooler
Very easy to install and perform very well ,5,CPU_cooler
"Works great for now, the fans are quieter than expected and look good. The controller is a bit iffy but it may be my BIOS setup not recognizing it.  ",4,CPU_cooler
The cap was really hard to open and had to use pliers to open ,4,CPU_cooler
Quieter than I thought. Really good budget cooler ,4,CPU_cooler
"Great looks but the cooling performance is not the best. Will work on a 6600K not OC, but under load it might thermal-throttle the CPU ",4,CPU_cooler
"Surprisingly good little cooler. According to TechPowerUp, it performs as well as the Hyper 212 Evo, and is much, much smaller. With only a 92mm fan, the tower is very small, but it cools really well! Messed up with the thermal paste, though - whoever thought a tiny packet would be easier to apply than a pipette? ",5,CPU_cooler
"Boy did I hate mounting this thing, regretting not going with an air cooler. I've done a custom open loop on my own system so I figured an AIO would be nothing. It was tougher than I expected because of how everything is already connected to each other. What's good however is that it was cheaper than the corsair Hxxxi GTX coolers and it's a 360mm. Good acoustics at idle which is nice. ",4,CPU_cooler
"Good: Reasonable price.
Great: Low sound.
Questionable: Big!  Make sure you have room.
Bad: Heat sink surface not flat at all.  Required heavy sanding and lapping to get flat. ",4,CPU_cooler
The colossal fan keeps the noise down making my current build almost silent even under heavy load. Installation can be a bit tricky and installing the fan to the heatsink is actually quite a pain. ,4,CPU_cooler
Had a little trouble with the directions but thank God for youtube. It keep the cpu very cool at about 50 F  ,4,CPU_cooler
An AWESOME budget all in one cooler  ,5,CPU_cooler
"better than stock cooler i think, is quiet ",4,CPU_cooler
"Radiator build quality is the best i've seen, no bent or damaged fins, perfect condition, as you should expect yet rarely see on radiators in my experience. The unit has a standard depth of 27mm however its a little taller and wider than the others i've seen. Also the end tanks are relatively small and that combined with the larger dimensions means theres much more real estate dedicated to the actual fins where all the cooling happens. Silverstone also have their own proprietary fin design, it looks great and also seems to help cooling efficiency as well, not sure how acoustics are affected if at all. Water block looks great, pump is inaudible. Also some more unique features here, no exposed bolts on copper plate and full metal construction. Overall just excellent build quality and engineering, the solution is a little pricey compared to others but the innovations and build quality are well worth it imho, not to mention the 5 years warranty. The only issue i have with this product are the fans. Their lowest rated speed of 1500 RPM is always going to be too loud for a system on idle. The fans seem to spin fine at lower RPM but i could only manage it through the system fan header by setting a custom fan curve in the bios. At ~550 RPM they are barely audible, not sure why silverstone didn't setup the fans to start at this RPM, 1 star has to come off for this. After trying 3 different AIO liquids coolers from 3 different big names and returning all of them due to poor quality control i am on the verge of becoming a fully blown silverstone fanboy, in my limited experience of AIO cooling silverstones quality is 2nd to none.

HUGE CPU cooler. Know that before buying. I had to change cases because this cooler didn't fit my old case. (Yes that is a little backwards but I needed a new case too.) I'm very pleased with the cooling capability but I shouldn't expect anything else from this ginormous thing anyway.  ,5,CPU_cooler
Very quiet.  Huge.  Looks great.  Cools well. ,5,CPU_cooler
"Looks awesome in my case, its is large and barely fits in it but it gets the job done. Keeps my processor cool. ",4,CPU_cooler
"This is a novel design in theory, but in practice it is not a very good product.  Sort of.  It cools as it should, but it does so insanely loud.  Also the mounting hardware was terrible.  It's difficult to work with and the knurled knobs for tightening everything down where rusted as soon I as got it.  I had to clean them up with alcohol and repaint them in order to make them look good.  I wouldn't recommend this product unless space is crucial.  Even then there are probably better alternatives.  The most obvious benefit is the fact that it's gorgeous. ",3,CPU_cooler
Right then i have a update for this cooler...do not get it..went to turn on my pc today and there was fluid on top off my graphics card?!?..i took the cooler out and notice a hair line crack from the bottom off it..so yeah it looks nice in the pc but please beware..even on the forums people are having the same issue... ,1,CPU_cooler

"Still evaluating this one, but initially, it gives quite adequate performance for a moderately overclocked I7-5820K. It is extremely easy to mount, and the fan is quiet. Doesn't cover the RAM on either side. Doesn't interfere with PCI-e slot 1. Fits in my Antec P100 case with lots of clearance. Is not overly heavy, so I have no concern about stress on the motherboard or socket. ",5,CPU_cooler
Pretty high-end air cooler. Keeps my CPU cool. Pretty cool. ,5,CPU_cooler
Quality components.  Quiet! ,5,CPU_cooler
"Put together very nicely and comes with a fan splitter to control all of your fans for the cooler off of one 4 pin fan port on the motherboard. The fans are high quality and quiet, and allow for some high speeds too if you need to up your cooling for overclocking. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Pain in the neck to install in Corsair 450D.  Impossible to add/remove fans after radiator is installed when used in conjunction with Asus P9X79 LE motherboard.  Good performance, just a little bit better than H100/i but might not be worth the hassle. ",3,CPU_cooler
Originally bought because it is black. Found out it is a great cooler. Easier to install than a 212 and looks fantastic!!!! ,5,CPU_cooler
Really Inexpensive but good at keeping my CPU at 40 degrees Celsius most of the time while being quiet! ,4,CPU_cooler
"This was previously in my main PC, but I put it in this after I replaced it with a CM Hyper 612. It cools decently well, but I am not real fond of the fact that the mounting brackets provided for AMD motherboards only allow it to be installed sideways (the fan facing up or down rather than right or left). I had to drill holes in the side of this case for the side panel to be able to go back on, but I won't blame this cpu cooler for that since the case is from a 13 year old prebuilt. ",3,CPU_cooler
"Very good looking, quiet, great performance. ",5,CPU_cooler
First off I love how quiet these bad boys are. The RGB lighting looks amazing and I'm really happy with my choice in CPU cooler. Can use the controller easily and is very straight forward. ,5,CPU_cooler
"Quiet, easy to install, and good performance.  ",5,CPU_cooler
"Amazing AIO liquid cooler, except that the fans suck balls. I am using two Noiseblocker fans on the radiator, and temps don't suffer. I found out that liquid cooling is necessary for X99 chips, as my Prolimatech Megahalems can't even handle the Intel Core i7-5930K CPU that's been overclocked. With that said, both coolers are amazing, and I'll find a use for my air cooler. ",4,CPU_cooler

"It manages to keep my overclocked AMD Phenom II X6 1055T at about 90c under Prime95, and about 40c under a gaming load. Installation was very easy. Managed to find it for $35 at Haltec. 4/5 ",4,CPU_cooler
It's a fan... cool. ,3,CPU_cooler
"Looks funky as **** but keeps the CPU cold. I want to upgrade to liquid to get this hellish thing out of here but its hard to  get myself to""fix what ain't broke"". After using this for a while I've found it to be the source of most of the noise in my case. It still works great as a CPU cooler but if you are at all picky about how loud it is you will want to either have some sort of voltage control or reduction, run the cooler passive without the fan at all or look into a different cooler.

"Amazing temps and noise volume have been very impressive, really cant imagine going to  a AIO set up with temps like these. ",5,CPU_cooler
I can't be too harsh on it. It does its job.  ,3,CPU_cooler
"Dead silent, very effective for its price. Rated for 130W of heat dissipation, so it should handle any quad-core Intel CPU overclocked. Mounting bridge and installation are very frustrating, avoid this at all costs if you have a small case. Factor in another $6 into the cost for some thermal paste, since the stuff it comes with is awful - you'll shave a good 5-10C off of temps just with better thermal paste. ",4,CPU_cooler
"Its simply great if I'm on my headphones unless I have complete silence in the room I don't even hear it working, and when I'm playing forget hearing it at all, plus it also has great cooling capabilities. Definitely worth every penny spend on it. ",5,CPU_cooler
This thing is beautiful and quiet.  I did a test boot before building and the heatsink fan was the only moving part. I ended up turning off all the noise-makers in the house to see if I could hear the fan. I couldn't.  ,5,CPU_cooler
"This cooler is a monster...... Beware of that if you buy it. It is HUGE and extraordinary heavy!
It cools way better than anything else I have so far used (in combination with Corsair ML fans) but I really hate moving with it if i toy around with my PC, this block alone is a BIG part of the overall weight in the completed system. Love the shape, that it cools big parts of the VRM, RAM and motherboard around that area + the CPU it self, pretty genius. ",5,CPU_cooler
"The stock cooler retail boxed with my CPU is a liquid cooler... so,  I knew I needed to go with liquid cooling. The LEPA Aqua Changer is more competitively priced than other similar coolers,  has thick and durable tubing,  the radiator looks equivalent to other AIO liquid coolers, and I didn't need additional monitoring software.   The mounting plate and the screws don't firmly fit to the motherboard with the standoffs (or really even stay together) until the thumb screws are tightened, but, once assembled, it's solid. The included  PWM Fans are a bit loud at 100%, but, when you turn them down, the sound level isn't bad and the grooved blades (similar to a Cougar fan) work great! It's keeping my FX-9590  27-30c at idle and mid 40s at heavy load. The waterblock/pump has a more industrial style than most AIOs, with a pair of deep red LED “parentheses”  (matches my  Asus MoBo).

"I had been wanting a V10 since 2009, and now 2015, I finally found a used one for sale and got a great deal!  Sadly, people on the Internets make fun of this cooler and bash it, but it's great because it's unique and rare. Cooler Master only makes V8s now.  I'm looking at this as we might at real car engines/manufacturers. This model is just not available anymore. There were a bunch of V6s and V8s (and still way too many 212s, though we all know how great the 212s perform for the monies). Having this V10 makes my rig special. So far, only one other builder on this site has a V10.  ",5,CPU_cooler
"I did not plan on getting at first. I forgot to order the recommended Silverstone NT06-PRO cooler with the RVZ01 case, and didn't want to wait another 3-4 days for it so I scour for any other suitable low-profile cooler. I couldn't find the Cryorig C1, Zalman, or Corsair H55, so ended up with the Thermalright AXP-100 Muscle. In the end, I am quite happy with it. It is so small that the stock fan that comes with the case still fits above it, and the CPU temp only goes up to 53 C under load. (no OC) ",4,CPU_cooler
"Overall quality is good, but there is too much noise and vibration from BOTH stock fans. ",4,CPU_cooler
"Good heatsink, but can't use the FAN in the NODE 202. With an FW121 it is same performance but less noise than stock cooler. I'll be testing with a better airflow and still good static pressure USV 12 next to see if performance improves. ",4,CPU_cooler
"Decent cpu cooler, takes up alot of space with push/pull but the temps are worth the sacrifice. 8/10 would buy again. ",4,CPU_cooler
Looks good with the blue in my build.  Keeps temps around 23 at idle and has never been over 47.  I do have this in cool ambient temp room as well.  I would recommend as well as buy again.

I had the stock with both CPUs to begin with but when the 8350's cooler started buzzing I decided it was time to get an aftermarket cooler and with this one being recommended by a close friend and being on sale on Amazon I decided to go for it and can recommend it to anyone getting an aftermarket cooler. ,3,CPU_cooler
"Amazing bang for buck cooler, delivers way better than stock cooler performance and is  way quieter too. Planning to use in my dad's new pc when I get a watercooler. ",5,CPU_cooler
No complaints performs better than expected. Keeps it cool and my whole case if I turn it full blast. Bumping this back up to 5 stars I found compatible thin fans. May sell the included ones. ,5,CPU_cooler
"Less than 6cm tall, this prevents my 100W CPU from getting hotter than 75ºC. The fan is quiet at idle and remains low-pitched when under load. If used with a Mini-ITX or smaller Micro ATX motherboard, you need to remove the entire cooler in order to access the RAM slot closest to the CPU. You most definitely need to use low-profile RAM sticks. ",4,CPU_cooler
"Massive mounting bracket, careful using this on a mini itx. fan can be cranked up pretty high, keeps cpu temps under 115°F at all times ",4,CPU_cooler

"This is a great cooler. It doesn't block the first pcie slot and is very easy to install. I don't have air conditioning in my apartment so I only plan on overclocking when the weather gets cold. However, even after using prime 95 with a 10 percent overclock for 1 hour I never get delta temps more than 32-33 celsius compared to idle. I was a bit disappointed to only receive one fan with the cooler as the symmetrical version does come with 2 fans. I did buy a 2nd fan just because I was curious nonetheless but it only improved temps by 2-3 degrees. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Really nice cooler, took the fan off the case lid and put it with the gpu fan  ",5,CPU_cooler

Bought this cooler at the end of 2010 and it's still running flawlessly almost 5 years later. This speaks volumes about the quality and reliability of this cooler. It's rather noisy when the fans are running at higher RPM but it is so effective that the fans don't need to run that fast in order to enjoy great thermal performance. I used this for my AMD build and transferred it to this build. It worked exceptionally well in both builds. Size is the only other con that I can think of. Make sure it will fit in your case before buying. ,5,CPU_cooler

Fits nicely in the case and keeps my pc nice and cool. ,5,CPU_cooler
"I had a difficult time getting this to fit into the NZXT Manta case, but it's not worth knocking off a star in the rating system because it's a case design issue. Overall the white look of the cooler is awesome and it keeps the system cool, so I can safely recommend  this cooler. ",5,CPU_cooler
"This thing is awesome works great, its powerful, and the price is great I would take one star away for having not having an RGB light instead its RED but it matches and the block looks great. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Doesn't block any ram slots, easy installation, great performances. Watch the height! ",5,CPU_cooler
"The little engine that could... the tiny Thermaltake Engine 27 is working extraordinarily well though I am only using it with a Skylake Pentium at the moment... waiting for Kaby Lake. The Engine 27 is more noisy than my Cryorig C7, though not dramatically so. It has an interesting low machine-like hum that up until now has not been distracting to me... at least thus far. I had anticipated a more buzzing-like and/or grating-like sound but instead it is producing more of a low humming, refrigerator compressor-like, report.  At top speed (5500+ rpm) it is more of a low whistling sound. ",5,CPU_cooler
"Keeps my temps between 34-40 when i tested overclocking a FX-6300 to 4.4Ghz. Max speed fan noise is very noticeably, fan noise doesn't really bother me since i wear headphones most of the time. When running at 75% speed i didn't really hear it. Was also easy to install. ",5,CPU_cooler
This is an amazing cooler. It does everything I need it to. It keeps the I7-5930k unbelievably cool. The stock fans are a tad noisy are my only complaint. ,5,CPU_cooler
"Great cooler, Had a little trouble installing took about 40 lbs of pressure to get both screws threaded thought i was going to destroy the Mobo or CPU but it works great after getting it on,  cut my temps in half. Cooler is large barely fits in my case so make sure to measure ",4,CPU_cooler
