"This is the best budget harddrive you can buy, there is no other choice in my opinion. ",5,HD
"Large amount of storage is nice, but this is very loud. ",3,HD
"Consistent Read & Write Speeds, but do not use this as a OS drive! ",3,HD
Amazing! ,5,HD
Salvaged from an office PC being junked. ,1,HD
"Had this for a few years, not much to say about it. no issues. ",4,HD
Pretty Slow drive. runs very cool though ,2,HD
Fastest SSD available right now.  ,5,HD
"Has lasted a long time without any issues at all, only complaint is that it is quite audible during long write times. ",5,HD
"Its a HDD, good enough for games and big trash data. ",4,HD
Great for storing my steam library ,5,HD
Currently using this hard drive for dual boot Hackintosh. I may swap it out for an SSD. ,3,HD
"Horribly slow, Found one of these in my basement though so Can't REALLY complain ",1,HD
An older OCZ-branded SSD - performance isn't as great as it used to be after a few years of use but is now perfectly happy running the occasional VM. ,4,HD
"My first SSD. Originally just had my OS, now it's dedicated to HDD caching. A bit slow for an SSD.... ",4,HD
"Faster than my brother during sex, this is an exceptional SSD for most purposes; fast, durable, and fairly affordable; I use it as a boot drive with the occasional game on it. ",5,HD
"First SSD used, definitely worth the buck for the performance delivered. ",4,HD
"Got it for free, a bit slow on startup, but it hasn't failed from years of use in multiple computers. ",5,HD
"Very impressed. The extra cache really helps, and files up to @4TB transfer almost instantaneously, before normal speed of @ 180MB/s resumes. A little bit pricier than a regular 4TB hard drive, but well worth it IMO. I foresee ordering more down the line.  ",5,HD
"Great speed, boots in < 5seconds. ",5,HD
Don't really know what to say about it but the boot speed is about 10-15 second restart and cold restart is about 20-25 second restart. Also Windows is annoying and only allows a maximum 2 tb hardrive but the nice guys at Seagate make it easy to split the unallocated space into a second drive ,5,HD
"M.2 drive I had planned on getting an 850 EVO, but when I saw a comparison between NVMe, M.2 and SSD I knew I wanted more. After nearly having a heart attack seeing the NVMe prices I settled for a much more reasonable M.2. Very happy so far!!  ",5,HD
"Have the Toshiba OEM version of this drive, got it for $180 off Ebay. Make sure you do a fresh install of Windows and feed the AHCI/NVMe drivers to the install. Fast as hell, takes up no room in the case!!! ",5,HD
"Hasn't failed after a few months, so that's good. No clicks or anything.  ",5,HD
We use Seagate Constellation drives in all of our servers and I use them in any build I do for work. They are extremely reliable and definitely worth the little bit of extra cost up front! ,5,HD
"Great and affordable SSD, good for holding windows and essentials applications  ",5,HD
"2tb WD Green i got/steal/borrowed/sneak into/ temporarily placed from my bro, thanks big bro ",3,HD
"Works well, not too many issues yet.  Mostly use it for date storage ",4,HD
"Seagate gets bad rep for failing drives but this one has been going for at least 5 years, it's from a dead laptop ",5,HD
"This hard drive has been abused since the day I got it and it still runs perfectly. Silent and fast. Not SSD fast, but it is a great HDD. Can't go wrong with buying this HDD ",5,HD
"This was a pricey piece of hardware, it will mostly be used for video game installs and photoshop/premiere work.  ",5,HD
"Bought sandisk extreme pro 480 Gb ssd on sale $220, but does not seem as quick as a 128gb toshiba pro ssd. But, numerous power losses with no data corruption, combined with 10 year warranty makes me happy. ",5,HD
it is fast and has done anything to my data ,5,HD
"Between my husband and I we've had five of these and only one had died in 8 years. Not bad at all.
This one is sharing a 60GB cache SSD ",5,HD
"I was going to get a 2TB WD Black. But for the same price I saw a 4TB Toshiba. I understand the quality is a bit different, but twice the hard drive space on a drive that's whole purpose is to have a lot of space seems like a no-brainer kind of deal. Picked this guy up at Micro-Center. ",4,HD
"Accidentally dropped it from my 70cm tall table and it still works, good job seagate. ",5,HD
Fast HDDs are sort of outdated with the advent of SSDs. These are fun to have for the cool factor and do perform better than any other HDD I've ever owned. They're fairly loud and distracting. ,4,HD
"Even cheaper, the OCZ 150 seemed like a better quality SSD.  This one just has the circuit board sticking out an opening for your SATA cables to attach to.  so it doesn't have the clips or anything to help them stay attached. also, Newegg exclusive.  I haven't needed it but I heard there isn't much support for this SSD. ",4,HD
Fast ssd. Never had one before but I'm glad I got one. Boot time is 12 second from a cold startup. But for 15 buck more you can have an 850 evo which is faster. ,4,HD
"Bought it some time ago. Largest at that time (and I think at the moment, too) 2.5"" 9mm HDD . Was looking for a laptop. Works as expected, although sometimes emitting high pitched sound (I would say mechanical/electronical, not really like a warning beep). Performance is ok, no problems with corruption or lock ups, so I didn't care that much. ",5,HD
"Its not the fastest drive, but its cheap so I got it. ",4,HD
Simple HDD. Deff faster than the Sata 2 :P ,5,HD
Always liked the Barracuda storage. ,3,HD
"Fantastic SSD! Solid performer, very fast and looks great as well. Very cheap in comparison to the other high end SSDs. ",5,HD
"I'm very pleased with this SSD. Windows boots up incredibly fast, and since I have my games on it as well,  I can connect to games faster than my friends. ",5,HD
Not the fastest hard drive but gets the job done and for 40 bucks its a good deal. ,4,HD
4 Stars for being 3Gb/s but otherwise a nice little TB container. ,4,HD
"Bigger Storage, was on sale on Amazon. awesome price for size ",5,HD
"It's nice to have this thing as a boot drive. I initially installed Windows w/o updating the NVMe protocol in BIOS, so I wasn't getting the screaming fast read/ write speeds as advertised. Updated the BIOS, reset Windows and bam! Who has time for load screens amirite? ",5,HD
this SSD holds my windows 7 OS (free for being IT major).  boots up really fast compared to my dad's dell laptop which has an HDD inside.   ,5,HD
"Let's be honest. Very rarely do you open up a PC product that isn't a graphics card or motherboard and have your jaw drop from beauty.  This must be without a doubt the most awesome looking 2.5 inch SSD on the market, beating out the Intel 730 Series quite handily. It features a red matte front face with black accent siding, and the HyperX logo in very nicely done rough single grain textured aluminum. I took a close up picture for the build, so you can see how it looks. It feels rough to the touch, and is very, very shiny.  Sequential read and sequential write are off the charts, tying the Samsung 850 Pro, thanks to the terrific Phison S10 controller.  Random read is great, but random write is mediocre (which is okay, as most users don't use that often) This drive beats out most of the offerings on the market, only being edged out in price performance by the Samsung 850 Evo. If you're not planning on showing off your drive, get the 850 Evo, but if you have a case that shows it off.... definitely buy this.  ",5,HD
"Funny story here. This is the HDD that came out of my laptop when I upgraded that to an SSD (Samsung 850 EVO 250GB) and has been my mass storage ever since. It seemed to be failing in the laptop, but after a zeroing it on a mac, seems to be running fine. Of course, I won't be keeping vital data on it, but it works as video and mass media storage.  ",1,HD
"Like a midget gigolo... cheap, fast, small, and looks good! ",5,HD
I use this as a dedicated scratch disk.  It's awesome and cheap.  Get it. ,5,HD
For what it is I am happy with the drive. It performs fine for it's specs. As it was rescued from another bit of tech I am happy. ,5,HD
Old drive from original PC and still kicking. WD has won my favor. ,4,HD
Great for games ,5,HD
The very first SSD I placed inside my build. Even though it's not my main SSD anymore I still continue to use it behind the two Samsung Pro's ,5,HD
The one I actually I got at Micro Center cost me $55 seems to be working . ,4,HD
"I like that the sticker was not cheap and therefor easy to pull off, while there is no sticker on the picture on this website there was one on it but it was shown on new egg, where I bought it. The SSD has had no problems so far it is fast but could always be faster but for its price and size it is really good. ",4,HD
"Does everything I expected from a reasonably priced SSD, I bought this around Christmas 2013. ",5,HD
"Reasonably fast large storage for a reasonable cost, what more can you want? ",4,HD
"This is an old, slow drive. I really only put it in here because it wasn't doing anything else. ",3,HD
"This series of SSDs is pretty much the only option for U.2 out there.  It's remarkably quick though, being capable of more than 4x read / 2x write speeds compared to SATA III.  Came with the appropriate cable, though you'll still need to attach on a SATA power lead. ",5,HD
"Your standard 256GB SSD, is reported to have decent R/W rates. Priced competitively, is a good buy. ",5,HD
"I didn't test this drive, merely installed OS on it but I was very pleased with the boot time, it looks promising. ",5,HD
PNY seems to be very reliable. ,5,HD
Perfect amount of storage for my OS and programs ,5,HD
"I boot in 15 seconds flat, bought it for sale at best buy. ",5,HD
"People looking to save room in sff builds, buy this. fast. and reliable storage.
Some say it's loud. I like the spin up in my rig, cause it sounds very high tech :) ",5,HD
This hard drive does what I need it to quickly. What else can I say? ,5,HD
"You could get cheaper and faster SSD's than this Plextor, but it functions similarly to other top SSD's out there, try opting for a Samsung. Only reason why I bought this was because it was silver. ",4,HD
It hasn't died in the first month. The R/W speeds pretty much match advertised. ,5,HD
"Speedy for a mechanical drive, great warranty, working well so far. ",5,HD
,4,HD
Basic data storage. I don't really need that much anyway because I don't have terabytes of adult movies on my pc :P ,5,HD
"Very average 5400RPM drive, I took it out of my laptop when I replaced the drive with an SSD,  would not recommend as a boot drive. ",3,HD
"It's only 5400 rpm, making it kinda slow. but it's a hard drive, and it works so not much to complain about. ",5,HD
This little drive speeds up application load times by caching data for OS. Took off star because no Linux support ,4,HD
This M.2 SSD is blazingly fast for OS boot. ,5,HD
Fast but not as Toshiba said. ,3,HD
"This is okay storage, but if you want speed, you know that you need to buy SSD. ",4,HD
"An older drive I've used for over 5 years. It's a bit on the slower side compared to a 7200RPM drive, but it's served well as an internal backup drive. And for about 3 years, it served as a boot drive in my old system (1.5 years in an Athlon II X4 system,  1.5 years in a Sandy Bridge i3 system) before I got an SSD. ",4,HD
decent budget SSD. I got it for $32.99 otherwise I would have gone with something else. I would not recommend this to be honest but it does for now ,3,HD
"Same trustworthy, dependable, Milhouse, err....I mean hard drive, just reformatted to hold and protect them files. ",5,HD
Western digital has been making HDDs for a while now and I haven't had one fail on me YET. Nice big 3TB HDD for the low. It does what it does.  ,4,HD
"I've always loved crucial products, this ssd drive has been pretty rock solid.  no problems after two months.  Read and Write speeds are more than adequate for your average user/gamer.  This was a great low cost solution for the build. ",5,HD
"Savage. This will change your life. The official driver is now out, but even the Win10 vanilla driver shows amazing throughput. This drive doesn't get picked up by the Samsung Magician software but hey ho. ",5,HD
"Reads are pretty fast, writes are decent. I honestly can't see a noticeable difference from my WD Blue drive. I think boot times are actually slower. Regardless, still pretty fast and a good upgrade from my mechanical drive. ",4,HD
,5,HD
Eh. You could get faster and larger hard drives for more money. Only buy for work/office PC's where you won't need to download entire games and don't need it to be as fast. ,3,HD
Gave no **** to me. ,5,HD
Broke these out of a couple of external drives. For storage - not the best but they will be fine. ,3,HD
I have used the green line as a server (red) and I have never had a bust in many years. And the price is the best. ,5,HD
"PC didn't even detect anything in this Sata slot at first, reboot and suddenly it's there. not sure what that was about but 7-8 second boot windows 8 with this SSD. Fast, No issues since. ",5,HD
"I chose this brand, product, and capacity for its low price point, and Mushkin's reputation for great SSD engineering, and to avoid the low-price companies with bad reputations.  Mushkin has designed non-Sata SSDs with extremely high bandwidth and fast random writes.  This product is not that; it is a commodity Sata-limited design.  But I hope the company has applied its engineering and quality skills here too. In the low-price SSD market, I avoid OCZ, ADATA, and companies that were unknown 2 years ago.  OCZ was once a premium brand in the RAM market, but nuked itself with a series of disastrously bad SSD products.  Its brand got acquired by a different company, but I don't know if their new products are reliable. I initially planned to augment the SSD with a 1TB 2.5"" hard drive, but then decided to not bother; 60GB total capacity is fine for now. 60GB was adequate for installing Windows 7 plus upgrades to SP1 (and next to Windows 10).   I initially tried using just a 30GB partition, but that was not enough to support the huge patch-update downloads to get from Win7 to Win7 SP1.  So 40-60GB may be the lowest practical size for the primary disk for Windows. ",5,HD
Got this bad Boy cheap from newegg worth the money spent! ,5,HD
For a Sata II SSD its quick enough. ,5,HD
"This thing is a beast and have been loving have my OS boot in 30 seconds. While the price of this has gone up in price I got it at a significant discount and run a few games off it, but mainly the OS and programs I use on a day to day basis. ",5,HD
"My OS is installed on to this, boots up super fast. ",5,HD
Old HDD from my laptop - not the best choice for installing games but I had it laying around. Will upgrade to a WD 1TB Blue 7200 soon... 4 stars here because it is really old but still runs ;) ,4,HD
Same comment as the SSD... It withstanded.. ,5,HD
"Sadly, this SSD was an early unit, and had to be updated to support TRIM. It's worked well so far, but after having scanned it and found about a 9% failure rate on the internals, I'll be looking to replace it, probably with a newer Crucial unit, or one with the new 3D SSD's. ",3,HD
"Eh. I was on a TIGHT budget, so I salvaged this drive from a laptop with a broken display, and, well, maybe it was good enough for the Toshiba Satellite it came in, but it's not really good enough for me. It has about half the read speed of my WD 7200 RPM drive, which for me isn't sufficient. I mean if you're coming here to PCPartPicker, assumedly you likely know a thing or two about building PCs, and so would like to choose parts that are of good quality/performance, or of good value.  This doesn't really satisfy either of those. It's not much more for a 3.5"" 1TB drive - just get one of those if you have the room. ",2,HD
"Bought used off of Ebay. Ssds are new to me, enjoying the fast boots. ",5,HD
My windows boots up in 10 sec. ,4,HD
No complaints. I bought this SSD over 2 years ago and it was a great deal then to run in conjunction with an HDD. Next build will be pure SSD. ,5,HD
Good low noise general data hdd. ,5,HD
"Bought it in 2011 and still going strong 4 years later. I was blown away when it first booted windows in about 30 seconds with everything loaded and ready for use. Updating the firmware wasn't the easiest task but when you do it once, you'll be able to do it again.  ",5,HD
"It saves power, but it's slow. My SSD is a million times faster than this storage device. ",3,HD
"Not bad, after 4 years still goes strong. ",4,HD
I store my games on here :P 4/5 Cause It's Not A SSD. ,4,HD
"Not the fastest, nor the sexiest. 128GB is just enough for common Windows apps. Just make sure you clean it regularly. ",5,HD
"Its well priced, fast and reliable.  ",5,HD
tad loud ,4,HD
"It used to be $20 on Amazon for one of these. Not worth it now, but 80GB is more than plenty for his needs. ",3,HD
"Does not deliver fast Read/Write speeds for an SSD, especially over time. Currently benchmarks at about 250 MB/s, well below what you would find on a Samsung 850/840 EVO or Pro for cheaper. ",3,HD
"Really great SSD, never had any issues with it. Super fast but does tend to slow down after installing a lot of games/programs. Reformatted and Installed a fresh copy of Windows and it's just as fast as it was when I bought it. ",5,HD
"Used for everything gaming. Seems as fast as the Kingston, but far less quality build. Bang for your buck, it fits the bill. ",4,HD
Cheap and quick! Restart time 29 seconds! ,5,HD
"A reasonably quiet drive that works as well as you'd expect. The only downside is a very loud click when the heads park upon sudden movement. Now that it's in a desktop computer rather than a laptop, this is no longer an issue. ",3,HD
"This SSD has been used for the OS and it does it very well, I had never really heard of OCZ that much but it does seem good quality. ",5,HD
An alright hard drive. Have only had two issues with it after 2+ years of use. Both issues did cost me all files on the drive. When first accessed when windows is booted up it can be a tad bit slow. ,3,HD
Black Friday sale price. Better performance than my other SSD. Glad I bought. ,5,HD
"The speed is well worth the price, beyond what words can say. ",5,HD
"Had a disk read error 3 days after I had my PC. But it's due to a disk management stuff I did. For the most part, it's an inexpensive SSD for that fast boot and shutdown routines. ",4,HD
"Fast and cheap. If it lasts long, I will be very pleased. ",5,HD
Got it refurbished on amazon very happy with the speed boost from my old 5400 RPM drive. ,5,HD
"This is a fast drive, I tell you hwhat. ",5,HD
"Cheap and silent mass storage. I use it for all my pictures, videos, etc. as well as storing any games I'm not currently playing. Fantastic in tandem with my ssd to get the best of both worlds. ",5,HD
Noisy but reliable. ,5,HD
"fast and work as espected!  cheap but with good speed, reliability and reviews (on internet) ",5,HD
Pretty fast as far as hard drives go. Great price. ,5,HD
"Found this old thing hanging around. Just cleaned it up and reformatted it and BAM, still works great! ",5,HD
"Words cannot describe how much better SSD's  perform compared to our old harddrives.  Product itself performs awesome, one my favorite parts on my PC. Before having my OS on my old 320gb HD felt like i was really bottle-necking my PC, like i had all this horsepower and no where to gallop :/ But now, after migrating the OS and a few applications, PNY 240gb (Or SSD's in general) Made my PC runs a great deal faster then i expected. I can shut down, start windows and be logged in, in less then 10 seconds. All applications load in a peppy manner (The way you want your computer to respond when you click on something)  which is just ohh so nice. Local Best buy had it for $82.98 and had them price match Amazon getting this nice addition at $74 ",5,HD
I made a mistake on this purchase. I bought off of  ,4,HD
"Quick and speedy for a mechanical drive. Got this on a 3.5"" to 2.5"" adapter inside the 230T and it doesn't make any noise or anything. ",4,HD
Served us well for 4 years now. I got no complaints.  ,5,HD
"~450 MB/s Seq write, ~280 MB/s Seq read I didn't look up this particular series of SSD from Intel before buying, I'm assuming it's a budget SSD with the performance. ",3,HD
"Heard a lot of horror stories about OCZ, but mine is over 5 years old and still works well. Wouldn't recommend anyways, OCZ when bankrupt for a reason and there are better, cheaper and larger SSDs available now. ",4,HD
"Had one in my old comp, plan on adding another and stripping them together ",5,HD
Cheap and fast! 8-10 seconds from shut down to password login in Windows. If you build a PC you MUST buy an SSD. ,5,HD
Does what it says. Not expensive and it's tiny (in terms of physical dimensions) ,5,HD
I used this HDD because it was a part i could salvage from an old broken laptop. Of course its not the best but it's lasted around 3 years with no problems so it's good quality. ,3,HD
"great drive so far, boots before the monitor turns on. ",5,HD
I only use this because I can't bring myself to throw it away and I don't know anyone who would buy it from me. It's very slow and I really dislike Seagate because they seemingly discontinue support for various products without notifying owners. ,2,HD
"took this out of an external HDD.  Runs cool and is stable, but no software support gives it one star off.  Still worth a buy if you find one around. ",4,HD
I did a clean install of Windows 7 and all my program files. The machine boots in seconds and everything runs fast. ,4,HD
"Recycled out of old system.  Used for libraries that aren't games or movies (documents, photos, downloads, etc.) It is slow and pretty outdated, but fast enough for this purpose. ",4,HD
"Worked great as my backup drive, but has now been replaced by a 750GB Samsung HDD. ",5,HD
Great SSD; going on 2 years now. ,5,HD
"My first SSD. Once you go fast, you never go back. I have my OS, and a large majority of my games installed on this with about 100 Gigs of space left. A complete restart takes 1:10, and a boot from powered off takes 25 seconds. I don't know what I did before this, but it must have been slow. ",5,HD
A tad noisy when reading/writing but still a great drive. ,4,HD
This is mainly so I can play Fallout 4 with zero loading time. Got this on sale on amazon for 129.99.  Its just to expand my Steam Library and keep my boot drive clear for other program files. Its works great!  UPDATE 8/16/2016 --- Works great. Fallout 4 loads unbelievably fast (I'm coming from PS4 loading times for it). It makes your play through time much faster and enjoyable.  ,5,HD
Quiet ,4,HD
"Pros:
Low price
plenty of space for storage
Cons:
very load hard drive
Not the fastest drive Ive owned, but that is expected from a drive that spins at 5400 ",4,HD
Nothing to say about this SSD really. It does its job ,4,HD
Great SSD having no problems. ,5,HD
Very fast and reliable ssd for a very small price.  ,5,HD
"At the time of my purchasing this item, it was cheaper than a Samsung 850 or 840 which I'd prefer but when I saw this go on sale for $50 I couldn't pass it up. I've got my OS and some games on it, all of which run amazingly well. Computer boots up in a matter of seconds. ",5,HD
"I knew I wanted a large SSD for games and programs, and at the time I really thought Crucial was the best bet. 8 months later and while I can say it's not the fastest one out there I really haven't had any problems. Still boots incredibly fast, read write times blow any HDD out of the water, and it's kept nice and cool at the top of my case. Note that the way it mounts the silver side is facing up, not the cool side with the logo. ",4,HD
It's not very good but I got it for free so I'll give it 5 stars. ,5,HD
It was salvaged from my old Macbook. Works fairy well. ,5,HD
So solid. ,5,HD
"It's not bad for it's price. If you have a few more bucks/Euros, I recommend a Samsung or HyperX instead of this. ",3,HD
blazing fast ,5,HD
"This is a Drive that I salvaged from a computer that was built in 2005 by my mother's ex. The PSU pretty much blew up at the end of 2011 and I kept it unplugged in my room until recently. I decided to finally take the HDD out because there were a bunch of family pictures /songs / videos that we wanted to keep. I transferred them to my other computer and I formatted the disk. It still works perfectly and for that reason alone, I think it's worth a 5/5! ",5,HD
Very good quality product. Works as advertised. ,5,HD
"Huge storage space for the price. Very fast for a HDD. Excellent for large file storage. I prefer a SSD for installing the operating system and frequently accessed files (i.e., My Documents, Google Drive, etc.), so this drive serves a longer-term storage device, since space on my SSD is limited and the SSD memory is so expensive. ",5,HD
Works so far... ,5,HD
"Running fine after three years yes I have the 64MB cache version, got in an Asus N Series from 2011 and still running strong with chkdsk zero errors, formatted twice since I got it, very solid hard drive as well as speedy storage. ",5,HD
Its a SSD what else can I say. With windows 7 installed a reboot is like 5 sec. Sometimes I dont even see the ASUS logo and see the Windows logo for like 3 sec. GET ONE IF YOU DONT HAVE ONE!!!!! ,5,HD
Great. ,5,HD
I wanted a big HDD to store media and not have to worry about space for a while.  I plan on setting up a job to image the boot drive to this drive so I always have a resent backup of the M.2 without having to backup to external drives.  The reviews for this drive seemed okay and it was cheap for the size.  It seems fairly quiet so far. ,4,HD
"This was the splurge for this build. I wanted the fastest I could reasonably put my hands on. Don't really know why. Just ""because"", I guess. ",5,HD
Does everything a mid-tier SSD should at a competitive price. ,5,HD
"Super, Super loud would not recomend ",1,HD
"This a great, inexpensive sad from a reliable company. I would say that this rivals samsung's ssds. ",5,HD
It's a nice ssd that looks great for a red and black build! Too bad it's hidden in the back of my case. ,5,HD
"[NEW] This is my main system drive - I use a Samsung Evo in my laptop which is a bit faster so just 3 stars here for the SanDisk. On the other hand, this one is pretty cheap so ... ",3,HD
reusing from old build ,5,HD
"Good SSD for $60. The read/write speeds aren't amazing, but it's still pretty snappy and much faster than a standard hard drive. ",4,HD
"It's a hard drive, it works. ",4,HD
"Rather fast HDD, able to record footage with ease. Works well, and no noticeable failures. ",5,HD
"Hasn't given me any problems, runs great. ",5,HD
"So far so good, fast and easy to install. If you need to migrate data Crucila provides with a stipped down version of Acronis. Good SSD for the money to be honest nothing to complain about. ",5,HD
"Extremely fast boot times, and no issues with installation or stability. ",5,HD
"Works well, not too many issues yet. Mostly use it for date storage ",4,HD
"Not bad, I only have this drive because it came out of an old laptop of mine. ",4,HD
"Very snappy, good solid SSD. Bought in 2012, and has been through multiple cycles of restarts and rewrites of files and re-installs of OS, still good. ",5,HD
"large ssd that works in my laptop, and with a $15 adapter, also works in my desktop. its fast, and i havent had any issues with it ",5,HD
"Used as my Steam/Origin/Uplay game storage drive. It is fast, spacious, and reliable. Best of all, no moving parts. The price tag hurts to look at, though. ",5,HD
"It's not the fastest SSD out, but it's worked well in the year I've had it.  ",4,HD
"Bought this used for a build and just use it for storage. Not a bad drive, but their are much better purchases. ",3,HD
Nice and quiet. Bumped it around a few times and still worked good. ,5,HD
"I have had this since Jan 2015. I got it on sale for 200bucks.This thing is a miracle and I cant wait to see what SSD and storage has in store for the future. Pros:
Silent, low wattage, fast as ****! Cons: 
NONE Hope this helps. Feel free to ask me any questions ",5,HD
So far so good.  My first SSD and probably my last since the Intel 3D-XPoint devices will be out later this year. ,5,HD
This is a compact drive that doesn't make much heat or noise. I just use this to store a few things locally on my PC. ,5,HD
"Amazing that they can make these so small, 500GB at the size of a stick of gum! Fast and reliable so far, cloned my old SDD to this with no issues. The Gigabyte Gaming 3 Z97 Motherboard I'm using disables SATA ports 4 and 5 (I think it's 4 and 5) when the M.2 slot is populated so be aware of that if you have that board. ",5,HD
"It's full already. Also, it's actually a 750GB one. But hey, who cares? ",3,HD
It's fast! ,5,HD
"Also scrapped a 500GB Caviar Blue from my old rig. Eh, fast enough and gets the job done. ",3,HD
REALLY overpriced but good performance. ,3,HD
"Got this in some promo.
Load times, transfer speed, write speed all pretty decent. ",4,HD
"Another part that I've had spare for a while. It's not fast, no, but there's a lot of capacity and we didn't have to pay anything. ",5,HD
This thing scared me at first. Installing it into the Corsair Carbide 400c's back SSD mounts was a bit scary because it scraped off some sticker that said warranty void if broken... I think I still have half of the warranty left. Thats the only reason its getting 4 stars. Otherwise my PC starts up in 10 seconds or less. Seriously fast.  ,4,HD
"Love it!  Fast, hidden, and no cables to run. ",5,HD
"My first ssd was a 60GB with just the OS on it, now I hate to say it, but this is really too small still, go for at least a 240GB+ ",3,HD
Got this out of an old computer but it's still good. ,3,HD
Got it on sale for 35 USD. Totally worth it at that price. Performs just fine. ,5,HD
Got it from my dad who did not use it anymore 10/10 for free stuff! ,5,HD
Very snappy performance ,5,HD
"Was in my old Apple laptop, so for free, it's great. Installed Windows on it, and I can boot into the OS in literally 9.2 seconds. It's very fast, I just wish it was bigger. If you've got it already, use it. If you really want an expensive SSD and have the money, there are probably better options. ",5,HD
Makes everything load up fast. Highly recommend this SSD to anyone. Comes with helpful software. Works very fast even on older sata 3gb ports ,5,HD
Had it since 2011 ,3,HD
"went with this ssd because of the fair pricing, gets the job done. ",5,HD
"Very quite and quicker than I expected at the spin speed, perfect for my needs as media streaming storage.  ",5,HD
"for the time, it was awesome. today? still is :D ",5,HD
If you do not have the money for  a SSD get this. It takes a while to learn which programs you run the most and slot them in the SSD portion of the drive. Pretty zippy but not a true SSD. This will be the storage drive when the SSD arrives. ,4,HD
Used price. Weird 'tweener size too. ,4,HD
so LOUD.  ,1,HD
This SSD is pretty old now. Paid way too much for it. But it reads and writes a bit faster than it is advertised to do. The Intel software that comes with it is really good and easy to use to. Vastly superior to my Kingston SSD ,4,HD
"When picking parts for this build, I found this ssd at a local frys and decided to buy it. Not having any reviews on pcpp kind of raised an eyebrow, I was a bit nervous to pick an add that has no previous user experience. But I've had no issues with it so far. It reads and writes quickly and is pretty capable. Would recommend. ",5,HD
"Very nice and fast 6gb/s drive.  My PC boots up and is usable in under 5 seconds, programs load lightning quick and installs are fast.  For the price it can't be beat.  Going to probably add a second one down the road and forgo ever getting a mechanical drive. ",5,HD
I honestly don't recall what the spinning drive is - i just am pretty sure its a Samsung / SATA 2 5400 RPM.  It was left over in the closet and adds space if he needs it.  He has the SSD for anything he needs fast. ,5,HD
Has not caused any problems for me! Good budget SSD! ,5,HD
Fast!!!  ,5,HD
"I received this HDD as a birthday present. 5 TB of storage, what more could you want? Hard drive seems to have that excellent performance that WD is known for and with the Black series there is a 5 year warranty so I feel very great about adding it to my rig.  ",5,HD
Build quality feels great (if that matters). Toshiba makes some good drives. Decent speeds. ,4,HD
Slow but good for mass storage. ,3,HD
it works perfctly for what it has to do ,5,HD
"Works great! I'm sure, if I were an SSD expert, I would realize that it doesn't have the  ",4,HD
"This is the first ever SSD I've had and I just... can't believe it. The first time I booted up my pc I just laughed for a minute straight. It was so god damn fast lmao.  Samsung are super reliable and I haven't had any issues with it and when I inevitably fill this SSD with memes I will definitely be getting a second, probably larger EVO. ",5,HD
"This one will host the OS, programs and some games.
A very good surprise as my first A-DATA SSD : Read : 560MB/s Write:480MB/s on CrystalDiskMark. Runs beautifully. The SP550 is a super price/performance choice here. Only cons : the real storage capacity is 111Go ",4,HD
Gotten as part of Amazon Prime Day Deal. Enough space for my games and files. Excellent read and write speeds. ,5,HD
Cheap for a 480GB ssd. Able to fully boot to Windows in 25 seconds. Not bad. ,5,HD
"The successor of the caviar green which is blue now.
Operate at low power and with no noise.
This one is hosting all my data and the rest of my games that won't fit on the SSD. ",5,HD
"A very fast drive and an excellent price. Wish I would have got the 480GB now, filled it in 3 days. 9 second boot. ",5,HD
"Purchased and installed two of these at the same time.  One drive failed within an hour with less than 400GB transferred.  Clicking, delayed boot, failed WD diagnostics test...  That's why four stars instead of five.  WD replaced the failed drive immediately and without question, awesome warranty and customer service experience saved the day.  I'll buy more in the future as needed, based mostly on the warranty and service. Some of my experiences:

"Stay away, I've had two of these fail. My current one will randomly unmount from the system and lose the data on it. ",2,HD

"Hard Drive for excess storage. barely use it for more than old videos, movies, music, and photos. ",5,HD
"It's what you'd expect from a standard HDD.  Not too fast, not too slow, but plenty of storage. ",4,HD
"since this was my 1st build i wanted to keep it simple as possible and I shy'd away from using 2 drives, (ssd/hard drive).   i gotta say i'm impressed with this hybrid drive..  i definitely  notice big difference in load times compared to the standard HD i had in my previous pc.. although, there is a learning  curve  for the hybrid to ""learn"" what you use often.. after around 10-12 reboots,  things really speed up..
 is it as good as a ssd combo? no  not quite,.. but i'm very happy with it ",5,HD
"Very good, use it for storage ",5,HD
"From the old build, had it laying around. ",4,HD
Perfect for my OS and a few games more than enough space. ,5,HD
"Got this free from my grandpa coz he needed more space. Not the fastest ssd out there, but it's still faster than a hdd. ",4,HD
"SUPER FAST! System boots  in seconds from fully shutdown. Excellent for working with large files, like raw photographs and video. ",5,HD
"Not as fast, as a Samsung 850 EVO, but the speed is enough for this build, and it's very cheap. ",5,HD
"Great M.2 SSD, may not be the best but it is still a great SSD and saves on cables. :) ",5,HD
"Very fast! This thing is much faster than my old Samsung 850 evo, it literally takes less then 10 seconds to boot up my system, with my old Samsung it usually takes 20secs to boot up my old computer. Just make sure to download & enable momentum cache. ",5,HD
Excellent as a boot drive with all my primary programs. Boot times are usually under 20 sec which is fantastic! ,5,HD
This is my OS drive and got it while it was on sale also. ,5,HD
"Not much to say, just perfect. ",5,HD
Ridiculously cheap for 1tb. It's insane to think how far SSD's have come. ,5,HD
Slow old harddrives I need to upgrade these. They have been faithful though.. ,3,HD
It works LOL. ,4,HD
"Fast, blazing fast. No issues here if your motherboard can support it. I have a Gen2 M.2 socket, so this is the fastest possible drive I can get, SATA Express speeds. ",4,HD
Super fast I recommend this ssd. ,5,HD
Paid a little too much for it at the time. But I'm happy. It's quick and boots up my system very quick. ,5,HD
"It works. The design on the top of the drive looks kinda neat. It's not visible in my build, but I wouldn't mind it if it was. Has plenty of space for a dual (or a potential tri-boot later). Probably could've gone with something half the size, but my mom wanted 1TB. ",5,HD
"Massive capacity for a good price. Hitachi is renowned for being reliable, and this drive has taken things very well. I've actually dropped the computer while it was packaged for transport (it fell out of the back of an SUV), and this thing never even had a single problem. Only con is that it's kind of loud when writing data. ",4,HD
"Excellent drive, only wish it was faster, it's SATA-based, it's at its limits. ",4,HD
"Fast Fast Fast!! Did I mention, Fast?!  Simply plugged in, installed drivers from the disk, set drive letter through disk management and was good to go.  Currently using this as a game drive not OS.. scores 2040/959 running crystal disk mark.   ",5,HD
"[OLD] A drive I have for several years that always kept all my games - in my new rig it is still in use for casual data (games wandered to a new, 1tb HDD because of space issues). A very fast drive which only runs a little hotter than new WD blue drives. ",4,HD
Insane gaming performance for a great price! ,5,HD
Now this is speed! It can boot from bios to windows main screen in 10 Seconds! ,5,HD
I got this SSD on Newegg's shell shocker deal just before the holidays. It looks great and it's really fast. I trust Intel for their processors so it made sense to trust them for my storage. I don't know how I lived without SSD's all these years.  ,5,HD
Does what I need it for ,5,HD
"works well, its super fast ",5,HD
"To store all the data, I have two RAID 0 arrays setup with the 4x4TB drives (added in Aug, 2014). The main array is hardware striped for performance, the backup is software spanned. Although, RAID 10 is easier to setup, its advantage of lower array failure require six or more disks. I have decreased energy use and decreased latency due to less disks having to spin up on access. I spanned the 2nd array for two reasons; performance is not as important, and a spanned array has a better chance for data recovery in the event of a failure. At the time, there was a good deal on these drives on Newegg, and I did manage to get these from two different batches (by luck). ",5,HD
At the time of this purchase it was by far the cheapest 1TB MLC SSD on the market at $250. There wasn't another MLC SSD under $300 actually. The benchmarks I've done show it's nearly identical to the Samsung 850 EVO I have.  Price to performance it was the best possible option but now PNY has released an upgraded line. From what I've heard the PNY 2211 is a very good successor to this SSD.  ,5,HD
Very impressed by its speed. Shame WD doesn't offer this much cheaper than the 1tb counterpart. Easily 5 stars ,5,HD
Works ,4,HD
I picked this up just because I wanted an SSD boot disk for windows and some games. ,4,HD
Blazing Fast ,5,HD
"Very fast to boot from, but this drive has had performance decreases in the past that Samsung has fixed, but now some people are getting it again. ",4,HD
THIS IS INCORRECT. LoL..... Too lazy to fix part but I actually put in a Samsung 850 Evo Pro SSD. I love it. I also use this Intel SSD as external sometimes.  Samsung = 5 stars Intel=4 stars* I would only go with Intel if I was going with a PCIe SSD ,5,HD
"While I'm not the one to really be reviewing how good a SSD is, I feel that the 600p is a amazing little SSD in a class of its own right now. Using a NVMe controller at the price of a SATA M.2, I think this guy is the way to go. It's faster at shorter tasks than the other SSDs in it's price range and a bit slower and longer ones, but for consumer use, short is the more common task. I feel like the price to performance is too good to pass up. ",5,HD
I've had this for a long time and it's been great ,5,HD
This is a hard drive i got from my grandmas pc when i build her one.  I took it from her old computer. ,5,HD
"Has a few bad sectors i guess, so sometimes i'm unable to copy from it.  ",3,HD
"I've built two separate servers utilizing these reliable drives, which provide plenty of storage. I am using stablebit's drive pool and drive scanner to monitor them . ",5,HD
Will probably need to replace it soon :/ ,2,HD
Extremely reliable HD so far. It has not given me or my system any bugs. It is perfect for OS install while you run everything else off of a larger HD. I load Windows in 3 seconds after cold startup.  ,5,HD
"I needed a hard drive and although it wasn't the best GB/$, it was certainly the largest capacity I could get for under $20. ",4,HD
Haven't done any sort of testing in regards to performance but its a huge improvement over a standard HDD. One of PNY's higher level drives but at the time of purchase I found it for less than the lower end models. ,5,HD
"Not much to say about this really, it's big and does its job. ",5,HD
6/5 stars ,5,HD
Had it lying around. It was from my wife's laptop when I upgraded her to an ssd.  It's a hard drive! ,3,HD
"(UPGRADED) The entire purpose of this drive is an environmental safety. I backup my data to it once a month, then it is stored in a fireproof, waterproof lock box. It runs a bit slow, but I expected as much from an archive drive. I would recommend this to anyone that has a similar need. It would not be quite so reliable as a primary storage drive, and likely much worse as a system drive. ",4,HD
Awesome product. I got this on sale for around $55ish. Boots my PC up in no time. ,5,HD
Fast enough for me.  For the price I think it's a deal. ,4,HD
"Works great, speed is as-advertised. It's a bit boring for putting on display in your case, but at least it's not covered in some lame sticker. ",5,HD
"I was using these for redundancy storage for media, I did have a corruption issue, but I am lead to believe it was due to software and not these drives. They currently have been replaced by a WD AW and put into a Linux Server and no issue thus far.  ",5,HD
"Its definitely not the top performing SSD, but its a hell of a lot faster than a regular 7200 RPM HDD. Solid performance and the Black Friday price was unbeatable at $200. ",4,HD
Back-Up drive. ,4,HD
Comes with an 8GB SSD built in and over time learns which files you use the most to give quicker access.  Good for an HTPC build as you save having two seperate drives. As it is over 3GB must initialise/format using GPT to access all the space in one partion.  Quite noisy. ,4,HD
Western Digital- thing is pretty quiet and quick for a HD ,5,HD
No problems. I have this in raid0 and loving it. ,5,HD
"Was fooled by Kingston's solid reputation, this SSD does not match up to its similarly priced competition. ",3,HD
Cheapest M.2 drive in this capacity that I could find that was compatible with my motherboard. Nothing to complain about really. I just use this for my OS and a handful of games for my HTPC. ,5,HD
I tend to stick to Crucial and Samsung SSD's at this time though on next few builds will try Patriot and Kingston. ,4,HD
"Unbelievably fast, I have my operating system on here and a few games and I can see a massive difference from a HDD. ",5,HD
"Has lasted me over 10 years,  only recently stating to give me read errors, so I can't really complain and have definitely gotten my moneys worth.  ",5,HD
"I have purchased several WD Red drives for NAS systems over the past few years and they have never let me down. I can't recommend these highly enough. They run nearly silent, and are not massive power hogs.  ",5,HD
It is not bad at all for a consumer SSD.  ,4,HD
Bought purely to installed Windows on. Took awhile to clone my original HDD but once it gets going its very quick. I can now boot into Windows and be up and running in less that 20 seconds. Would highly recommend one of these or any other SSD for running Windows. ,5,HD
Hits its rating of 1570 MB/s on sequential reads and 540 MB/s on sequential writes in benchmarks.  Also has a 5-year warranty.  I'm currently using this as a boot drive and it's been blazingly fast on startup.  This seems to be a great M.2 drive for the price-point. ,5,HD
"AMAZING drive, not the best, not the worst, looks great too  ",4,HD
"The HDD works as is, but I'm concerned for it's reliability. ",3,HD
Coming from a HDD for years and getting this was like going from night to day. Well worth the money spent from the sheer speed I have. Even made the 3TB HDD seem faster for a Steam library. ,5,HD
Wow loving the boot time it is so fast no waiting! ,5,HD
"I read that these have a high failure rate, but so far so good. Some concerns though, it runs at 48 degrees (almost 20 degrees hotter than the other two drives I have in the build) and its firmware update software doesn't recognize it. Still functions well but I'm a little cautious.  ",4,HD
Not the fastest SSD around but the price/performance/space ratio is great even at its normal price. ,5,HD
It's a 1TB 7200RPM hard drive with 32MB cache. There is really nothing more you could want at this price point. Amazing speed 5/5. ,5,HD
Slow old harddrives I need to upgrade these. They have been faithful though.. ,3,HD
"This drive is my OS drive. Browsing about the OS is really quick, and R/W speeds are pretty good. Recommend. ",5,HD
"This thing is amazing.  I use it as a boot drive.  It was super easy to set up for that purpose, and my boot up time is almost negligible at this point.  Definitely keep it mostly empty, though.  That will make sure it stays blazing fast.  Also a note on durability:  I actually dropped this piece right onto the floor as I was assembling the computer.  I almost had a conniption fit, but was able to stay calm enough to put everything together anyways to see if it still worked.  No issues whatsoever.  Obviously you should be a lot more careful than I was being, and I do not recommend dropping this or any other part, but I think that does speak to the build quality that Kingston has put into this.  ",5,HD
A great HDD from Toshiba! Nothing wrong here! ,4,HD
"Love this SSD, had to do a clean reinstall of windows 10 to fix some crashing issues so I upgraded from 120gb ssd to this 480gb PNY. It looks cool, came with software to transfer my old drive if I wanted to and so far the overall performance is great ",5,HD
"Its enterprise grade although I didn't need it need it to be, it was a added bonus, its a little loud though.I brought it refurbished and haven't had a problem with it. ",4,HD
Nice gaming hdd. ,5,HD
"Pretty slow, not much cache, even tho I'm not sure what it does but still compared to others (16mb-64mb). Got it used for ~$20. Not bad. ",4,HD
boots up fast wish i would have gone for the M.2 though ,4,HD
"i read that the maximum read speed was 330around, but when i got mine, in crystaldiskmark it said the read speed was 546?!  ",5,HD
"OK when you have it laying around, also, the speed difference isn't noticeable. It also is very reliable, not many errors in the month of use I have put on it. ",4,HD
"Trustable brand, only 450 GB usable though. ",4,HD
"This ol' drive had been kicking it since 2009. A little on the slower end but it totally makes up for it though sheer lifetime. It's gone through 3 computers so far, but it's still running like it did in the first. Now it's mainly a storage drive, but I'd trust this thing to hold my files for years to come. ",4,HD
"This drive is fast, I'm getting 511.2 MB/s read and 432 MB/s write speed. I ended up paying 179.99 for it and boy was it a sweet pick up. ",5,HD
"Cheapest 128GB M.2 SSD at the time of purchase, and is very fast, Windows 10 boots in 3-5 seconds approx. ",5,HD
This Hard Drive is Great 1TB is a Great amount of Storage and its great for the Price ,5,HD
"Buying this disk was a very last minute decision, just minutes before I started building it. I had another old disk I was going to temporarily use for my initial install/setup, but decided not to wipe it and that I should take advantage of an SSD. Unfortunately, the store I went to only had this one available. It does the job as it's meant to do, but it's definitely not what I really would like to buy for this build.  ",3,HD
Greased lighting fast and comes with a 5 year warranty.  Enough said. ,5,HD
Great SSD for the money ,5,HD
"Great, fast HDD. Needed more storage for my computer and walked down to best buy and bought it. Been using it for holding all my games, and running them of course, and it's worked great. ",5,HD
"Going on four years with one of these, not a single issue. Just as fast as Samsung's 850 EVO. ",5,HD
"Hitachi drives are very well rated, and their Ultrastar line has a better uncorrectable read error rate than their Deskstar line.  I found a 2TB drive for under $100.  For that price, I feared it might be an OEM pull with thousands of hours on it, but SMART showed it was brand new. ",5,HD
"These drives are massive and fast, for a 5400 RPM drive.
I'm currently running 2 of these in my NAS and using Windows Storage Spaces to create a 2-way redundant disk. I'm planning to add 2 more of these into my NAS soon. ",5,HD
"Pretty cheap for a 7200RPM NAS drive, reliable. ",5,HD
"This ssd is fast, solid looks, stable and i think is under rated. I heard alot of bad review on this ssd. I can say i am very happy with it. faster than my Samsung 840 evo  ",5,HD
It works and is sufficiently faster than a traditional HDD. Nothing special ,4,HD
"Great inexpensive SSD. Samsung 850 EVO would've been my first choice and Crucial MX100 my second, but this was on sale for $70 and I couldn't resist. ",5,HD

"FAST AS GOD HIMSELF, I'm not sure how the 750 Series can beat these. ",5,HD
"A bit loud sometimes, but does what it's supposed to. ",4,HD
I love small form factor storage. I have 10k enterprise Seagates. I will use them all the time. ,5,HD
Your standard SSD / HD combo ,5,HD
"My ""go to"" SSD has been the Samsung 850 EVO but I stumbled upon this little gem on a newegg sale and decided to try it. After purchasing it I read a few articles that showed how close in performance this is when compared to the 850 EVO. I was able to get it at a much lower cost; so far I am impressed. ",5,HD
"Kinda small, but its super fast. ",4,HD
,4,HD
"Got this one for $99. I was contemplating using a SSD for the operating system only in a smaller capacity and also using a 1Tb HDD for program/app/media storage. 1/2 Tb isn't a lot of storage nowadays but with the cost of SSD storage falling rapidly I decided to get a moderate solution temporarily and upgrade to a higher capacity later, Perhaps with a RAID or M.2.

stores games and other crap i dont need all the time . 10/10 would buy again ,5,HD
"I got this because, of course, it matches with the ram sticks AND it runs a little faster than the Samsung 850 Evo. I'm a sucker for that little edge. Boots up my OS in a matter of a snap. Won't even let the windows icon form. ",5,HD
"This drive was also highly rated.  Was going to skip it originally, but at this price, I had to have it.  Is  ",5,HD
"Intel SSDs are always solid choices, but this one disappointed me a bit. The read/write aren't as good as I was expecting and a Samsung drive beats it outright (840EVO).

Barra...Barracuda! ,5,HD
This is your average 7200RPM HDD. It works very well to store games. ,5,HD
Super Fast. Great price too! ,5,HD
"Meh, its alright. It works fine, only a little bit of noise. ",3,HD
