Bought off  For the price you can't go wrong with this card. Think of this as a major upgrade from your GTX 970 FTW 2.0+.  ,5,GPU
"Coming from two 970's in SLI, this card is a treat. It runs better than both of those cards combined and I'm very satisfied with my improved 1440p performance. This is a placeholder however until the 1080ti or Titan P are released. Since this model is factory overclocked, I wasn't able to get much further of an overclock out of it. I wasn't able to get a stable overlock at the coveted 2100mhz, but I'm right on the cusp at 2088! Plays Witcher 3 completely maxed out with hair works off at 60fps+. Keep in mind this card is huge because of the three fan cooler. Make sure you check case compatibility.  The Aura lighting is a lot of fun! I had issues downloading it from the included disc however. I attempted to download it twice from their website before being successful. The fans have yet to kick in that are plugged into my card. It honestly doesn't need the additional cooling. In SLI it would be more useful with the added heat. This is easily one of the most aesthetically pleasing cards available right now. It manages to look good without being too gaudy and it will fit in with any build theme due to the simplistic grey/black and RGB lighting.  ",4,GPU
Absolutely loving this card! The MSI version is great! The fans barley turn on during light gaming! I am yet to run benchmarks on this card but when I do I will be sure to update you guys! This is a great card for the casual gamer! Great price point! An Overall Beast! ,5,GPU
"Still runs okay, even for today. Overwatch gets an unsteady 60 fps on low, Doom 2016 gets ~30 on minimum settings. Both of those are at 1080p. ",5,GPU
"This is the only part in my computer that i bought used. I found a good deal on it and got it for $40 before I even planned on building a computer for myself. I did manage to get this overclocked just a little bit(25 on clock speed, memory refused to overclock.) I plan to upgrade to a GTX 960(Staying Nvidia because i have a nvidia shield TV and gamestream is nice.) This is going to be the first upgrade I do on the computer because the 1GB of VRAM is a very limiting factor of my PC currently ",3,GPU
Great gpu for the money. It also stays cool despite a 60 MHz overclock on the core and 125 MHz on the memory. Idols at 28 degrees Celsius. Browsing the internet and youtube brings it up to 35 degrees Celsius. The hottest it ever ran at was 61 after one hour of Heaven benchmark. ,5,GPU
"Great card for 1440p, ultrawide monitors, and 4k but would recommend a 970 or 980 for 1080p if you are going NVIDIA. ",5,GPU
"This card is 3 years old and I just purchased the second one used. In SLI, 2x old GTX660's = a single new GTX970. I am getting 80 fps in GTA V (1920x1200, high to very-high default settings). Only problem is coil whine.  I know, I know, but I am waiting for Pascal and DX12 before upgrading.
For now my screen is 24"" -1920x1200 and don't need to upgrade until I get the 30"" -2560x1600 screen I have been drooling over. ",4,GPU
"Bought it from a friend, and it can run all my games at 1080p high settings. ",5,GPU
"I got a 1440p 144Hz monitor for 200 dollars that I traded for this reference 980 and a 970 ftw, sold the 970 for 180 so I effectively got the 980 for 20 dollars.  Oh man this card is a monster. It runs Witcher 3 over 60 fps with every setting including hairworks cranked to the max. I love my GPU and it looks absolutely fantastic as well as being quiet and cool. ",5,GPU
Fits in case nicely. Will have more benchmarks in the future. I suspect it's actually being bottle-necked by the 860k. ,4,GPU
"Paired with i3-4170.  So far they work nicely together.  Recognized and installed with no issues on fresh Windows 10 build. No issues with any games or software installed so far and testing (Starcraft II, Witcher 3, BF4). LOUD fans. At idle temps I can't hear the fans, but any game I have installed, temps go 70+ C and fans run at 100%. I know that is not that hot, but no matter what game it sounds like a jet engine. Card feels cheap (plastic fan housing and such). I would not take a star off for that, but just noting.  Using as 1080P card and cannot comment on higher resolutions. I am installing additional 120mm fan to provide more air and hopefully ease up on the card fans. the card is performing well, and I got for under $175 after rebates. From all of my research, this is the best bang for buck card at around $200 price. If noise is not an issue for you, then this is a 5 star card, but the fans are just too much for me and why 1 star off. ",4,GPU
"Can surprisingly keep up with a GTX 970 even though it's technically a ""refreshed"" R9 290. A few minor crashes so far but overall it's a great card for the price. Compared to the GTX 970, 4GBs more VRAM really does help for multi-screen setups and that's what I was mainly going for. ",4,GPU
Great card. I have not had a single problem with and and honestly it was a great purchase in my eyes. ,5,GPU
"The Ti was not out when I got this card, so it was the best thing to ever fall in my lap. Absolutely destroys anything I throw at it. ",5,GPU
Great little Card! Runs World of Tanks on medium settings at 1080p better then most other $60 cards. This card wouldve cost about $100-180 but we got a refub for $60 at Microcenter. ,5,GPU
"Beastlies GPU I have ever owned, and it is not that loud very tolerable.. play everything at the highest settings at 1920x1080 with no issues at all.  The cooler died and from waht I have read its a common issue no more sapphire products ever. ",3,GPU
"Would I change it if I could go back? No. While it's struggling with AAA titles now (even with lower settings), this thing has allowed me to play all games on full for years. No complaints. ",4,GPU
I don't have a anything special to say about this card I bought it only to have some decent gpu when I want to play something... ,3,GPU
"Nearly five(?) years after release, this thing refuses to go down without a fight. Rocking that 1050MHz memory clock, along with the 300MHz core clock (boost 900), it can handle max Gmod settings, Subnautica on recommended, Arma 2 on medium settings (some things tweaked a bit).
I find keeping shadows off/low REALLY helps. Nothing else bogs this card down than shadows, even AA. Love it. ",5,GPU
"Beautiful design, cool LEDs, silent under load. Remains at 59 degrees under a furmark stress test for 5 minutes. My favorite card series available for budget builds at the moment. ",5,GPU
"Works pretty great, but there are better modern alternatives for the same money. ",4,GPU
"This card looks plane but performs very well!  I got it stable just above 2,100 Mhz.  Crushes any game maxed out in 1080P gaming! ",5,GPU
"I decided to buy this when it was on sale because I wanted a non-blower design at a reasonable price and also because overclocking is not one of my priorities for my machine. However, I did achieve some good results. Let me preface by saying take this with a grain of salt, since my results could be unique. Out of the box, I was getting between 1898MHz and 1873MHz without doing anything. It just ran that way. Then I decided to do a modest overclock with EVGA Precision. After some testing, I set a +500MHz on the memory and a +150MHz on the GPU clock. I had heard that was about what people were achieving. I set the Thermal and power target to max and set the fan at 90% for testing purposes. These settings are stable. Final result is a steady clock of right around 2050-2000MHz, depending on the load. Of course your results may vary. I do still think like people have said that this is the perfect excuse to sell FTWs that may not meet a spec, but I am very satisfied with my results. ",5,GPU
"Seems like a monster, again need to learn more on overclocking and get gaming. Seems to stay pretty cool under stress test just below 70 c and 29 c idle. Noise levels not too bad either. Update: Now overclocked.....  ",5,GPU
"Running like a beast.
Nothing else to say about it. ",5,GPU
"Was pining for an unattainable Titan X, then my prayers answered.
Needed a blower style card, upcoming AMD Fury has none, so I did not wait until E3. Also bought backplate from EVGA. ",5,GPU
"A great mid-range card for anyone on a budget. Runs older games (WoW, Minecraft, Terraria, TF2) on the highest settings @1080p without breaking a sweat.  ",5,GPU
"I'm not a hard core gamer, so I don't need the latest and greatest.  This card meets and exceeds my needs.  It runs quiet and cool, even when the fans spool up to higher rpm's.  So far it has handled everything I've thrown at it without really breaking a sweat. ",5,GPU
"I bought this card second hand for about £15, for that money it is very impressive and beat my GT 610 that i paid £40 for! ",4,GPU
"very very impressed with this card. this will play ps2 at 4k on ultra no msaa with 50 fps, toxikk on 1080p full msaa on ultra with well over 60 fps even in big battle areas. also, card is pretty tiny so it will fit in very small mini itx cases nicely. good price as well ",5,GPU
"Pros: good performance, silent when idle and under load, fan noise very soft Cons: no backplate included, only 2GB of RAM ",5,GPU
"Powerful, sleek, low profile and power efficient. Perfect for me. Only downside is the lack of a back plate but since I'm using a closed case it doesn't really matter for me. ",5,GPU
"Great card, very fast, very powerful, demolishes nearly every game I throw at it. It's a shame that EVGA doesn't factory overclock the DT, but it's plenty overclockable anyway.  ",5,GPU
"pain in the backside to get going tbh, but was cheaper that r9 270x which both are the same basically ",4,GPU
"I was originally hesitant to get this card, since I'd heard numerous reports of the Gigabyte models having horrible coil whine, as well as people saying how the plastic on the card felt ""cheap"",  but I'm glad I didn't listen, because this card has really impressed me in the short time that I've had it. For the price, it feels solid, and offers some features that I wouldn't expect from a card at this price range (customizable LED lighting, fantastic cooling with dual fans, and a nice modest backplate). The Gigabyte software is also pretty easy to use, as well, and lets you further tune in your desired settings (including a range of different LED options). The only thing that I'm not a fan of is the orange accents and asymmetrical fan designs, but as I can't see either when it's inside my case, that's a moot point. All in all, I highly recommend this card if you can find it for around $250, it's a great value, in my opinion. ",5,GPU
"Oh man. As someone who'd been using Intel HD graphics for the last two years, let me tell you - this is amazing. Full 1080p, Ultra presets, 60+ FPS, oh my good golly.  Games I've tried it with include MGSV:TPP, DiRT 3, DOOM, Borderlands 2, GRiD, Skyrim: Special Edition, and Insurgency, all of which perform beautifully. As for this specific model, the fans turn off when the GPU is under 60C. Which is nice, but still, it's not that big of a deal since I can't even hear the fans at all until they're at about 60%. I've heard a lot of people say they don't like the look of this card, but I personally do. The red accents match my case, and the white (well extremely light blue) MSI logo looks rather nice, especially in the dark. To summarize: I really like pretty much every aspect of this card ",5,GPU
"Impressive piece of hardware, everything on ultra at 1080p, silent and efficient.
ANd very high settings at 1440 resolution... Geez probably the best hardware on my build...
so powerful and silent!. ",5,GPU
"great card,upgraded from the strix 970 and this thing is smoking every game I pay totally maxed out,gamed the 970 was having some really bad stutter on even overclocked as high as I could get it,this card hasn't been overclocked by me yet but ive not had need o even try,can only imagine the things this can if I sit here and mess with it for a day and get it pushed to the perfect limit!!I recommend this card to anyone that can put up the funds to get it,its totally worth it!! ",5,GPU
"Good GPU, gets high FPS in games and is quite cool. Looking at ~60FPS Medium-High on 1080P ",5,GPU
"Best budget GTX 1080! Got it under MSRP! This thing is beast, no game is too much for this card to handle..i upgraded from a GTX 550 ti and WOW! night and day differences ! I did alot of reseach and people are saying that temp is getting too hot,  reached up to 80 c or above. i did full loads of test on the card and temp never reach 80 c..74 c is the most i seen..i think the problem is airflow..i got 4 intake and 4 exhaust fan. ",5,GPU
"I like the aesthetics of this card, but I don’t like that I couldn’t get a 960 like I hoped. I for sure will let people not to go to the store to get a GPU, as they are overpriced at both Best Buy and Micro Center. Also, if you are planning to use this with an analog monitor, be sure that the monitor has a DisplayPort/HDMI/DVI input (and you have a cable of one of those types), as this card DOES NOT in ANY WAY accept analog signals. ",3,GPU
"Love this thing.  Absolutely love it!  I originally had a GT 740 and while it worked, I knew it wouldn't hold up over time.  I changed it out to a XFX 280X and loved that too but I wanted to be pretty future proof and knew I had to get more.  I ended up getting this after having Best Buy price match it at about 319.  Traded in the 280X (Which was 219) and bought this after paying the difference.  It is great.  9093 3DMark score on Fire Strike.  Have dual monitor setup right now with another cord hooked up to my 55 inch for watching movies. ",5,GPU
"I  bought two of these founders edition cards to run in SLI. All of the founders cards are the same (spec wise). ASUS was offering game incentives with purchase so I purchased this one. I also wanted to support ASUS as they make good quality products. Also look at the warranty each brand offers. If you plan to play in 4k (which I do), two cards will give you the best experience. NVIDIA is dropping support for 3 and 4 card SLI. A single card will not allow you to play most new generation games at 50-60 fps on max settings at 4k. I was running mid 40s on a single card on most max settings. With the edition of a second card, I was able to max out everything and push 60 fps. There are occasional scenes that drop into the 40s but otherwise it sits at 60. These cards are extremely easy to overclock and people have been able to get large gains on air. I currently have the following OC: GPU clock to 2050 MHz and  memory clock to 5500 MHz. Plan to add water-blocks in the future. ",5,GPU
"Ginormous card which requires two 8-pin power connectors. For some reason it doesn't perform as well as I though it would. According to benchmarks I've looked at, its supposed to run at around 150 FPS Ultra settings at 1080p in Battlefield 4, but I'm sitting at around 100, constantly dropping to 60. The fans sometimes stop running, even when in game which is quite worry some. The LED configuration is laughable, as they do have a strobe light mode and the color variation is abysmal. Do not buy this card. ",1,GPU
"I bought this one way before my old computer died, i was lucky to get the Core edition instead of the Dual Fan one.
It does it's job fine and runs everything i play on Max.  ",5,GPU
"This card received a lot of hate from YouTube reviewers, but I'm honestly satisfied, the temps are normal for me, doesn't go beyond 74C° after long gaming sessions, and it's very silent I can barely hear it (most noise coming from my PC is caused by the stock intel cooler). I had to change some voltages and clocks though using Wattman and it's all good now. ",4,GPU
"I was worried about AMD cards using too much power and overheating, so I wanted to get Nvida card but the GTX 960 was too weak for me and the 970 was too pricey. So I chose the new AMD 300 series for the right price and performance and the lower power usage and temperatures. High quality brand. Supports DirectX 12 so I assume I'll get notable performance boost in the future. It has 4GB which is great for modding Skyrim. ",5,GPU
"I was directed by AMD to buy this card because It ""matches"" best? with A10-7890k? what that means is still up for debate because it was  15-20 FPS increase, but if you look at it from the stand point of totally increasing FPS over 30-60 fps in total than I guess it's well worth the 80 bucks?  I think that this was the goal that AMD was trying to acomplish by keeping the a10-7890k intergrated graphics matched with R7-250 graphics card at a total frame rate allowing us to attain better graphics on a above average task level? Well at least it sounds good, and I'm ok with it. ",3,GPU
"Man oh man do I like this card. It stays consistently cool, and is unbelievably quiet. With a more aggressive fan curve I could probably overclock this more, but I like the complete silence. ",5,GPU
"This GPU has all what I wanted! Pros: Monstrous design, MSI (my favorite brand), PCIe 3.0, SLI capable, DVI to VGA converter, MSI logo with led, Twin Frozr V and its intelligent and advanced cooling (when I'm not playing, fans doesn't spin), silent as ****, cool and cool (u'll understand...), low power consumption (only a 400 W PSU required!),  it's big (I love big GPUs), red & black color theme, the high quality box/package. Cons: 2 more pins than the Asus Strix one, no sticker D: (why?)  ",5,GPU
"It's cheap, but for only a little more, you can get a slightly faster R5. Performance is good enough, though. Keep in mind that no matter what the advertising says, this is not a gaming GPU! It's fast enough to run old and lightweight games, but you can't seriously expect anything at this price point to handle more than that. The R5 220 is best suited for budget machines with bad or nonexistent integrated graphics. This is a niche that's steadily shrinking with the onset of better integrated graphics, which means we'll be seeing less cards like this one in the future. ",4,GPU
"I tested the games and benchmarks below with my  CPU at stock 4.0mhz and my Asus Dual RX 480 4gb set to OC mode with NO manual adjustment to voltage and power target:

"Very nice looking, but runs pretty hot. It'll take quite a bit of tweaking to get it both quiet and cool enough for extended gaming/benchmarking sessions. ",4,GPU
"Now, you'll notice I gave this card 4 stars; this is not because it performed better than I expected or had some crazy awesome features that made me really like it.
I gave it four stars because it performed very well given it's age, clock speeds, and architecture. I could barely recommend that this card be used by a gamer of any stretch in today's market (unless you play games that are not graphically demanding or are otherwise very old). However, if you're a light gamer and focus mostly on productivity functions with your computer, I would have no problem recommending this card. It's a solid choice for everyday functions, and I was even able to run a fairly new game a medium-low settings with a somewhat decent framerate. For the money though, I deeply regret not going for a different card; buying a second hand GTX card or Radeon R7 series would have been a much better investment for my purposes.  ",4,GPU
"Great Amazon Warehouse deal at the time. Shame the 970 came out so soon after. Other than that, it plays anything I want with great fps. Love it.  ",5,GPU

"This is my first video card so I lack the knowledge and experience to provide any sort of in depth analysis. The only game I've had the chance to test it on thus far is New Vegas, which it runs at Ultra High settings with no problem. Not loud, not hot. No complaints. Oh, there's an LED on it that you change the color of, but the guy at Microcenter said that this feature doesn't work if I'm running AMD, so the LED just stays red. ",4,GPU
"I bought the 4B model because the free Witcher 3 product key justified the extra cost. Very happy with my choice. The card looks great and comes with a nice back plate. Temps never got above 60 degrees under heavy load. I've only benchmarked one game so far. I avg high 80s in Bioshock Infinite with everything set to Ultra, but that game is not very demanding. Will come back and edit after I get Witcher 3 benchmarks. The promotion is now over for the free game, so if you find a cheap R9 280X it is a better performer, but this card is great also. ",5,GPU
"Nice looking white low profile card.  Not the fastest but it's fast enough for my office pc and I can still play a little Grid Auto sport if I'm bored of the office work ;)
 Anything faster cost quite a lot more. ",4,GPU
"I just love the reference card of nVidia, I would do anything to get my hands on them - luckily a shop had a sale from 180 I think to 150ish, so I just bought it straight away! I have no problems with it whatsoever - all games run 60+ FPS on ultra (my games that I play). I love the way the LED lights up. ",5,GPU
After spending some time with it I am happier than I was when buying it.  I reset the overclock and am very pleased.  Runs 1080p well for my setup.   Getting great FPS average with high settings.  Doesn't run hot and the blue led is nice.  Very capable mid range card. ,5,GPU
"This little unintimidating piece of hardware has impressed me. Judge something by what it was meant to do. Well, this thing can do what it was intended to and do it very well. ",5,GPU
Painful to get judging I got it like a week after release. Newegg had like three in stock though. ,5,GPU
"Quite, cool, and looks spectacular. This card is truly better than the 750 Ti in every aspect save for the low profile/half height. If you are not bound by that restriction, I highly recommend this. ",5,GPU
"JUST upgraded from a 760 to this MONSTER of a card, This thing is literally a god and scored triple on 3dmark then my 760, for 90 more dollars..... My 760 died and I got a warranty on it, they don't sell them anymore, so they gave me my money back essentially, bought this and will never look back. ",5,GPU
"Looks great, works great, fits in my case, the whole package! I definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking for a budget GPU under $200. ",5,GPU
"The r9 280X is the last generation graphics card for AMD, but is still runs today's games very well when paired with a decent processor. The only draw to last generations graphics cards is the power draw. However, that was not enough to take off more than one star, as this more than gets the job done. ",4,GPU
This was probably one of the parts I was the happiest about. We were able to snag this for $205 with a $20 MIR effectively taking the price down to $185. For that price I couldn't be happier. It stays super cool and quiet and so far has been pretty good at overclocking. ,5,GPU
"Runs almost everything I've thrown at it at 4K/60fps, except some of the most demanding newer games, and even those run well with minor visual quality adjustments.  The hybrid cooler is probably overkill for the box I built, but it keeps my temps at or below 50C at full load so I'm not complaining.  The RGB LEDs are also a nice touch if you have a window on your machine. ",5,GPU
"The only reason why I  got this is because I got a killer deal at Best buy for this. 4gb, nuff sed. ",5,GPU
"I put this on a custom block, just tears up 1440p w/ Freesync. Temps are awesome, draws a lot of power. Complicated to Overclock well. Nice sized card for most builds. Cool LED's ",5,GPU
Great card for the money! Runs alittle hot and you will not be able to overclock it much past what it already is since its running pretty hot. 70-75 degrees depending on room temp.  ,5,GPU
"What can I say about this silent beast? Not only does it provide more than enough power for my gaming needs, it also saves me power and does not heat up. It has an ACX 2.0 cooling which allows for energy saving and only turns on the fans when needed. For the price, I really love this GFX card and how it performs when I'm working or gaming. ",5,GPU
Great usage for low-end games! ,5,GPU
"Amazing Performance, but it runs hot. 5/5 ",5,GPU
"If I could give this thing more than 5 stars, I would. It's amazing, but coming from an iGPU I guess I don't have a really accurate baseline. I mainly play Overwatch, and I get 100-120 FPS at epic preset 1080p 140%. Even that only brings it up to about 60% usage, which just blows my mind. I haven't played much of any other game, but the few that I have have been awesome, so that's a plus. It physically looks sweet, and the cooler obviously performs awesome. So far I've only overclocked it +100Mhz on the core and +100 on the memory, and it automatically boosts to 2.1Ghz, so I'm not sure I have to push it farther right now, so maybe I'll wait. --EDIT-- after multiple days of testing, I got it to OC to +135 on the core, and +500 on the memory (it could go farther, but I don't see any point). Note- I put the power limit to 110% and voltage to 100% in MSI Afterburner, so if i didn't do that i probably wouldn't have gotten the OC that I did. Also, the software (Xtreme Gaming Engine I think is what it's called) sucks. The only time i used it was to change the LEDs, and try to use it to OC. It straight  up didn't work, and froze every time I went into the settings menu. I just switched to Afterburner, and that seems to work fine, so I'll just use that from now on. ",5,GPU
"Runs cool, aesthetically pleasing. -1 star for the VRAM fiasco with Nvidia. ",4,GPU
"A nice RX 470 4GB from Asus. This thing is near silent, even when the fans are at 1800 - 2200 RPM, but when it reaches 2500 RPM, it gets LOUD. It also gets real hot. On idle, it sits at 50 C, and under load, it touches 80 C. But it does have a 0db fan option, so it explains for the 50 C on idle. It also has decent OC potential. I haven't tried anything extreme, though. It's good for what it is. ",4,GPU
"Unfortunately, despite being a GT7xx series card, it's somehow still inadequate for the game bar recording feature in Windows 10.

"The last addition to my build sadly. It does work though because I was able to set all the graphics settings to Ultra (or the highest available) on every game I had after installing this buddy for the Dual Graphics. May not be the newest, but that's for the next build. For now though, it does a great job. ",5,GPU
Wowza. That's all I can say. Wanted a nice upgrade from my R7 260x and figured I'd go all out. Was not disappointed. I'm able to max out all the games I play currently and still be able to Vsync at a solid 60fps.  The BestBuy model comes with two lighted fans preinstalled. Looks great. ,5,GPU
"I'm changing my review to four stars because I think I just got a bad fan with my card. I contacted XFX and they sent me a new cooling unit that was much quieter and dropped my temperatures, too. XFX has a great warranty service and they were very quick about things. ",4,GPU
"Great Performance out of this card at stock speeds, I would suggest this to any builder on a tight budget. ",5,GPU
overclocking leaves a whole lot to be desired but this thing does perform like a beast right out of the box. it appears EVGA didnt bin their chips though so you can wind up with a faster founders edition if you win the silicon lottery ,4,GPU

"The graphics card is one of the most important parts of the gaming machine and probably took the most amount of my decision making skills to decide on what to get. Ultimately I chose this model and am very satisfied. It can run every game I have at 1080p on max settings without breaking a sweat. Nvidia Geforce experience even increases the rendered resolution higher on some lighter titles. ""The sweet spot of gaming."" ",5,GPU
"Stays pretty cool and does a good job at handling light gaming, and can handle even modern titles at high-medium settings at a good FPS. And a good price for performance mark. ",5,GPU
"While my friends had given me their spare case, fans, psu etc. to help me start my build, this was the only thing that I ended up using for Diamond (rest was from scratch) and it's been really awesome so far! My only concern was that it got pretty hot (72-78° C) under load depnding on the game. This worried me at first as I compared this temp reading to the other temps in my system (cpu, mobo, storage) but I searched it up and most info I found explained that this is totally standard and something I shouldn't get too concenered about. Newbie days. I run Dark Souls 3 on high at around 40-50 fps. Overwatch on high @ 60-70fps, ultra @ 40-50fps. Dota 2... maxed settings at 100-120 fps. Fun fun. Will be replacing this when I can get my hands on a GTX 1070 (or possibly the latest Radeons, 480x or 490x) Yea! ",4,GPU
"Not super aggressively clocked, but it has a small form factor and runs cool. A few reasons why I chose this card: -AMD has more driver overhead, and on an i3, it's very noticeable. 1% lows are much lower generally  -The R7 370 specifically is kind of a hunk of junk. It's actually worse than the 270 before it, which I would have considered if there was one on sale when I needed it.  -the 950 destroys the 750 Ti for not much more money, but the 960 isn't that much of a step up  -the new wave of GPU's are about to come out, so the more you spend, the more you're probably going to wish you waited ",5,GPU
"I own the AIB Gaming X version of the card with the Twin Frozr Cooler. It is currently sitting over clocked to 1360 Mhz on the core and Memory at 2000 Mhz . Providing a very stable platform across many different types of games including online Fantasy MMORPGs, First Person Shooters and any and every Single Player Locally stored game I own.  Have not found a title yet that I couldn't run smoothly at 1080P 60FPS and high settings.  Eventually I intend on Running Dual cards in CrossFireX, but for the performance, this single card is giving me, I have no reason to be in any rush to do so right now. MSI has a winning RX 480 with a very solid cooling and power solution.  ",5,GPU
Bought off of Reddit. Mainly purchased because gpu #2 was sent from a RMA and XFX is an incredible company. They also do NOT void warranty for removing stock heat sink unlike other companies so this made adding on the NZXT Kraken G10 an option. Coupled with the Corsair H50 temps rarely exceed 66c. An incredible upgrade compared to crossfire 290x hitting 90c+. ,5,GPU
"Ah the bane of my sanity. I sold a 85% ASIC GTX 970 WF that would overclock to 1565 on air  so I could get this beast. The overclocking is much less impressive in terms of numbers, the ASIC is 64.2% so I got screwed in the chip lottery. It will run a slightly higher than factory overclock on memory and about 1406mhz on core stable. Overall the quality of the card is very high  and I have no complaints regarding it achieving advertised values. Voltage is a bit high but stable and it even overclocked it draws less power than advertised under a full load in Furmark. The temperatures while overclocked are also average, about +45c in Furmark, with the fans running at about 85%. I have a custom fan profile set in order to keep the fans on at all times running at the lowest RPMs which is why my idle temperature is about the same as my CPU's. The fans can be heard when ramped up but it is a negligable sound even though my PC sits beside me on the desk, the sound doesn't bleed into a microphone sitting beside the case. My benchmark scores are about average with it and just slightly slower than the SLI setup my previous 970 went into. I use a 1080p monitor and this thing chews through games at that resolution, even GTA V only gets it to about 60c and that's after a few hours of playing. ",5,GPU
"I haven't really tested out the GPU much yet since I doubt my wife wants me to game on her PC but for the price, the look, small over clock seems like a solid deal for an older card. I dig AMD and this gave me a chance to try out some products I would't normally buy.  Cooling so far seems excellent, runs silent, Windows 10 drivers worked with no issue.  ",5,GPU
"Founders edition to water cool. Love this thing, so powerful ",5,GPU
"Nicest looking card I've ever seen! Performs phenomenal and stays really cool during idle and during gameplay. It will destroy all modern games at 1080p max settings and can even take 2K gaming. The card fits in with all white color scheme cases, ",5,GPU
Runs game I wanna play at a minimum FPS of 60FPS or more. I recommend this. :D ,5,GPU
"Works great.  Just wish these Canadian stores had the RX480 cards in stock faster, but I was lucky to find one in stock before it went out of stock again.  So far it plays games really well, 60+ FPS Highest settings on BeamNG Drive and CSGO, and more. ",5,GPU
"I got this r 260x to play Skyrim, and it did that well. Also handles BF4 with ease, but met its match with Dying Light, as I mentioned earlier. Low, low settings nets you 25-30 FPS; playable, but nothing glamorous. Then again, low settings on PC Dying Light look great and appear to be beyond next gen console, so no complaints.  ",4,GPU
If you can get this for under 30 dollars then that is a amazing deal although it won't get you very far.  ,4,GPU
"So far so good.  I've always had good luck with Sapphire cards.  I have a Saffhire 7000 series card in my old XP machine, 14 years old, no problems. ",5,GPU
"The 280x was picked up from a reseller on eBay. Sapphire's warranty is based on the serial number so you can save some $$ by going with a used card. From the reviews I was a little concerned that the Sapphire-X might be too loud, but I haven't noticed anything crazy. ",5,GPU
Not this exact version. It's this one: H270XQ2G2M with the blower. Bought used for pretty cheap. Awesome value card but sags like hell as you can see. ,5,GPU
Can't believe it can still keep up in alot of games. ,5,GPU
"Good for the price. A few hiccups with overclocking, but solid performance otherwise. Should have frankly waiting a few months for the 900-series to come out (and the price drop of the previous generation). I'm still not complaining! ",4,GPU
Screams when pushed but great performance for the money ,4,GPU
Crazy power with a crazy price ,4,GPU
"Runs quiet and cool, and absolutely perfect price for my needs. Snagged this a couple months ago at  ",5,GPU
"Great video card, super easy to overclock, and very quiet even while under large loads. ",5,GPU
"Passively cooled on idle, this sees relatively high idle temps of around 50°C but the silence is well worth it in my eyes. The cooling system consists of three copper heat pipes and a massive aluminum heat sink covering the whole card. Under load i never see the card reach above 80°C, fans don't appear to exceed 70% of their maximum speed, even under load. Manually setting fan speed to 100% and its incredibly loud, at 3500RPM i guess thats somewhat expected. Fortunately you will never actually get to those speeds unless you have some serious dust issues. Personally i am thankful for the extra capacity of the fans, to take a star away here seems a little unfair since the card itself never appears to exceed ~70% in normal operating conditions and thats in one of the smallest itx cases around. Overclocking isn't great since gigabyte voltage locked these cards, perhaps related to the custom PCB. There may be a way around this in the future but with stock voltage don't expect core overclocks to exceed 1100. Gigabyte loses one star here, maybe a little harsh as i am still seeing a 6% overclock and i dont think you are likely to see a r9 390 double that figure. Great build quality overall, they even included a very nice metal black plate, very nice product. Plenty of people have reported issues with powering off/on and rebooting with these cards, i haven't seen any of these, card works flawlessly. ",4,GPU
"Oh Gigabyte, when will you improve your crappy software? OC Guru II just feels outdated and it is required for stop and silent modes. The stock thermal paste was thin and this card running so freaking hot was the reason why I went through this case change. Runs hot and loud and you can't change the LED on the cooler which is disappointing. Locked voltage on the card since this sucker is pushing the architecture about as hard as it can go. ",4,GPU
"This Graphics Card can take any game that is thrown at it. it get 100-80 fps on GTA V max settings at 1080p, 1440p it gets around 75-60 fps and 4k around 50-35 fps.  ",4,GPU
A great cost-effective card.  Very happy with it. ,5,GPU
Obviously not for a real gaming system but works for what we needed. ,3,GPU
"A bottom of the barrel model from nVidia and PNY. This kind of GPU is a dying breed, because modern integrated graphics are sufficient for many people's needs. There's still a niche for these cards and very old computers, but it's just that - a niche. For most people, there's no point in buying one of these. That being said, I have a bunch of old computers, and these can be had for quite cheap, so I do like it. ",4,GPU
so far so good...just wish I could turn off the red fan LED...only negative I have so far ,5,GPU
"MUCH cooler than the previous defective ASUS STRIX R9 285. The GIGABYTE card has a sexy blue LED WINDFORCE logo, the card is surprisingly small, and it performs REALLY WELL on a 900P monitor! ",5,GPU
"The coil whine drove me crazy, so I decided on a custom loop. Not only did the coil whine stop, but it also looks much better. The tubing of the AIO cooler on the fury X was a pain to work with in this mITX case. Reason I chose this over a 980 TI was because of space. If I would have gotten the 980 TI, I would be unable to fit in my pump/res at the front.  ",4,GPU
"When you can get a R9 Fury at the same price at RX 480, you know you get a good deal. Target temperature at 75C load, which is pretty normal on GPU card, and you can even undervolt the card for better efficiency. At 40% fan, it hardly makes noise. Totally destroy 1080p, but greatly shine at 1440p. The only things to nitpick on are: ",5,GPU
"Getting old, But still the kind of card that can still punch above it's weight in 1080p. This has to be the low part of my 6700k build and begs to be replaced by 1070/80. 'Does the job though'. ",5,GPU
Best card between 200 and 300$ at the moment.  & with XFX you can't go wrong. ,5,GPU
"I'd say it's for entry level gaming, no video rendering. Will run most AAA titles at medium settings with FXAA off. ",4,GPU
Works alright for the price I bought it at. Though it works well I do not like the very high temperatures and it doesn't run anything very well. ,3,GPU
Great card! Runs The Witcher 3 on Ultra settings 1440p at 70-80 FPS ,5,GPU
"Warm card, now I have a HD7770/R7 250x. 2gb Asus. Gave the 470 to a friend who has a FX-4130. He's happy, I'm happy. ",4,GPU

More than enough card for the 1080 gaming my son does (and way faster than his friend's 960 :-) ) ,5,GPU
"Beastly little card, runs a little hot but can handle all games on a high.  Would prefer a 480 to replace it ",4,GPU
Good god the graphic quality...I won the lottery here for $250. ,5,GPU
Bought in mid-2016 on clearance to replace my HD7950 . This is a beast of a card. Max almost every game I have at 1080p. Still does near-max quality with the new 2560x1080 monitor. ,4,GPU
Very good variant of the GTX 750. Performance is close to the 750Ti and has very low temps under load (Under 50C). ,5,GPU

"Stupid quite, raw power in a beautiful package! Runs really cool even when overclocked @ 1375MHz! ",5,GPU
This graphics card is a beauty and a beast.  Glad I went with this one.   A little on the heavy side.   The price could be a little cheaper.   But great card!  ,5,GPU
"Sapphire, along side Vapor-X know how to cool their AMD GPU cards well. It'll only be noisy if you choose to overclock it. The price and performance you get out of it is a main feature despite it being an afterstock cooler. I've benchmarked it with single and 2-way Crossfire. It's an overkill in terms of 1080p for one card on just about all modern games. 4k on one card struggles even with overclocking. Less than 30 FPS is not viable with it. 2-Way Crossfire is fair game, however and is playable on that resolution. Another benefit is that it has  With all that performance, comes to slightly more noise. It's surprisingly not overwhelming and it's tolerable. I'd look elsewhere if you're attempting to find a quiet card to work with. ",4,GPU
"Great card, in SLI beats 980SLI on the majority of 3840x2160 benchmarks. The 3GB of VRAM is a limitation in modded Skyrim with ENB though, causes stutters. Phenomenal on everything else though. ",4,GPU
"Runs cool, stays decently quiet under all workloads. ",5,GPU
"Pros: Killer card. Even the factory OC settings are impressive. BIOS switch is awesome.
Cons: Doesn't make me breakfast. ",5,GPU
"Pros: Nice all black aesthetics with high lights of red on the fans.
The card stays very cool while being put under any amount of stress.
when I ran it ran fairly well however the number of times that the card would cause a crash due to being unstable are a huge draw back from what could been a very good 1080p gaming graphics card. I was getting good frame rate from several games including Battlefield 4 and GTA5 at around 50-70 fps, however as I stated many times the card would just inevitable crash my main monitor and the only way around it was a full reboot. I have found this graphics card to be very unstable even at stock clocks and I have been frequently forced to bring the clocks down below stock, I may be speaking to XFX about this and finding a way to rectify the problems. I will update this review later if I do so and what the out come of that is. Okay so I spoke with XFX about the R9 280 behaving strangely, and they offered for me to send them the card, however I wasn't quite done tinkering and trying to figure out what was wrong at first, so I continued and fortunately when AMD released their latest set of updates, it seems to have alleviated the problem, I am still being very cautious and don't want to push the card too hard however I am pleased to say I have a very stable overclock of 1100MHz running with no crashes as of yet, my belief is that the issue resided with the Catalyst Driver itself,  and lets face it AMD isn't currently known for the best drivers as the previous driver I was using was over a year old.

"The GTX 780 6Gb was an experimental card. I've had it for a long time now & it still feels like it isn't supported by everything. For instance my Geforce Experience thinks its a 3Gb 780. Its still omega powerful, but it just kinda blows that they sold the card for 3 months & stopped production shortly after. Also had to RMA twice before I got a card that actually worked on display port. ",3,GPU
"Its an awesome card for only $200 (price when I bought it in Nov. 2015). Its very fast and has plenty of VRAM. Also the price to performance is awesome. The only problem is it is a stock R9 290, so it has issues with heating and cooling. ",4,GPU
"This card runs a bit hot, and comes in a cardboard box. But other than that runs like it should and for the price of a R9 380, can't beat it. ",4,GPU
Amazing graphics card for only $170 at the time of purchase. Cheaper than the other 960s yet still overclocked to 1.3Ghz. Performs great with my Intel i5-6500. ,5,GPU
"Pretty decent for some years old gpu, but noisy when under load in pretty much all games. ",4,GPU
"Runs any game I want on very playable frame rates. Runs hot, however. ",4,GPU

"Great GPU. Very quiet, and very powerful at 1080p. ",5,GPU
The best Performing GPU under $250.00. Creates a lot of heat but the frame-rate never drops below 60 fps with any game on a 1080p monitor.   ,5,GPU
"This GPU runs just about any game at almost max settings. Stays nice and cool, but can get loud at times.  ",4,GPU
"Runs at 74 C on full load, but very quiet and is a good value for it's price. Or at least used to be, it's pretty outdated now, so I'd suggest getting a GTX 750 Ti at least. Still runs great after 2.5 years though! ",4,GPU
"One of, if not the current best Nvidia 1070 available. Cool temps and top performance. ",5,GPU
"This thing is a beast for the size!  Turn up the power 50% and increase the max fan speed, and it reaches the performance of the R9 Fury.  Without increasing the fan speed, the clock is throttled down from 1000MHz to 900MHz or lower.  You probably don't want to set the fan speed to 100%, as then it sounds like a jet taking off :)  Also, it will also limit its lifetime. ",5,GPU
Not much use in 2016/17 but it can run older or less demanding games very well. ,3,GPU

I searched it's name on  Once it comes in the mail and I install it, BOOM, great deal. Subnautica at 30-45 fps on med/high, stranded deep at 40fps on high/ultra, and 80-120 fps on Unreal tournament on med/high/ultra. It's the best price you will find for a video card. It is said that it takes up tons of power, but my card takes up only twice the power of my cpu. The fans do whine, but with headphones on you don't notice. ",5,GPU
"Purchased as a pair on eBay. Note that one of them is a HD 6950.
I was concerned the blower style would be noisy and bought replacement heat sinks and fans but haven't used them. The noise isn't too bad.
If you overlook the terrible decals and power munching nature of these cards the most you can say is they do the job. ",2,GPU
"This card has shown quite a lot of promise for overclocking.[Voltage,Core Clock, Memory Clock etc all seemed to have a good deal of headroom.] Very stable under stock settings (Although I did run into an unusual issue where my wireless networking card  caused instability in benchmarking etc. even when not connected to a network.) That said, this is not an ultra high end card, so you should not expect miracles. In my case it works well in my media hub connected via HDMI to a 40"" Television & DVI to my 17"" monitor.  ",5,GPU
Very cheap price yet very good performance for games that aren't very demanding. ,5,GPU
Great for games like GTA 5 that are VRAM hogs. Since it's pre-overclocked it is a bit loud though. ,4,GPU
Good quality and picture and 1 gb of extra memory ,3,GPU
"Its big, its loud, and it handles games like a champ. Not sure if its an AMD thing but I do sometimes find that it has issues with older DX9 titles (like micro-stutters etc). Can't overclock too far but I've got it running at 1050MHz (40MHz overclock) and undervolted by -30mV ",4,GPU
"The graphics card could be a (possible) regret. I may wish I had went up a step, we'll see. It seems to work great for the games I've installed so far, but I haven't tried out any of the more recent releases. So I don't think it's been pushed very hard. Benchmark tests to come. ",4,GPU
"Docked a star for not coming with a backplate.  docked another for the sub-par I/O layout. Overall, I am happy with the card and the I/O won't really affect me until I move to a multi-monitor setup.  the performance is pretty good, I haven't bothered overclocking it yet, might do that depending on performance with Fallout 4. If I were buying new, I wouldn't get this card. ",3,GPU
"This is hot. Yes, in the sense of being beautiful and having the special ability to make scrambled eggs. If you can't cool this don't get it, simple as that. I was skeptical with the release of ""Grenada"". But this takes the fight to the gtx 980, somehow. It has decent overclocking capabilities no problems to about 1160 MHz.

One of the pinnacles of it's generation. ,5,GPU
"The R9 270X 4GB, I've really liked, and with the case and mobo only having the space to hold 1 full GPU, this one fit our budget and has a lot of bang for it's buck.
I've been able to play Sniper 3 Elite on Ultra, Alien Isolation on Ultra (though you can really hear the GPU working for this one, but it handled it)
This is what I did the most research on.  For the price-point, it seems like this has the best bang for your buck.  ",5,GPU
"I can't be more pleased with the performance of my XFX Radeon R9 290x GPU. Right out of the box I paired it with a I5 4690k, and got 300 fps on CS:GO and CS: Source, as well as maxing out fps on LOL on the highest video settings. All of this was right out of the box, without overclocking. ",5,GPU

It performs like a BOSS, compared to my old 760. I still only game at 1080p so I don't need more than this for ultra settings. ",5,GPU
"I was so excited when I found this GPU. I couldn't find one that fit my theme well at first. I had settled on the Gigabyte Extreme Gaming GPU for its RBG LED's, but the shroud was still black. I was about to get it and paint it white when I came across this Galax beauty. My only complaint it how heavy it is. Without a GPU support it looks like it's going to break the PCI-E slot right off the motherboard. Even with a GPU support it sags a little. This thing is a tank. Even still, it's fast and cool. Performance is awesome.  ",4,GPU
"Overpowers every game I throw at it so far and it's still trucking along. I bought mine used but in good condition. I don't like the plastic covering not being all that stable, but it is not worth the loss of a star when it more than does what I need it to do. You don't need to get the best video card at outrageous prices when this little puppy can cut through most everything with ease at a fraction of the cost(unless you care about bragging rights).

Amazing. Haven't overclocked because there's no need. Got it refurbished from EVGA b-stock and there was nothing wrong with it. Never seen it go over 41C even on Heaven maxed out. Runs every game I own including GTA V at max settings on 1920x1080. Whisper quiet. Also there's just something about having a water cooled graphics card that adds a bit of uniqueness to your pc. ,5,GPU
"I love this card! It has excellent performance for its price point, and it does a good job with the midrange games I've tried it on. It also comes with a good set of utilities that I find useful, particularly the screen recorder that's fairly basic but very easy to use. Interesting that it has 3 DP connectors and only one HDMI. If I want to add a second monitor, I'll have to add a second card or (presumably) plug it into one of the DP connectors. Regardless, I'd buy this card again in a heartbeat. ",5,GPU
Everyone is probably wondering why I went with this and not AMD 260x for 82$. Because this was only 50$! after rebate through newegg. This is the perfect starter card at this price and will be ready to upgrade to a gtx 970+ in the future. I love it runs cool and quiet with no problems and I like the Geforce experience app. I can play LoL all max settings 200+ fps. I'm gonna try out Hots next and other games ,5,GPU
"Amazing GPU; 4 GB VRAM, and it processes data faster than I thought it would. Not a fancy 900-series one but still very powerful. ",5,GPU
"Big improvement over the 280x, which was a great entry level gpu.  I'm excited about the possibilities of VR in the future with this one.  MSI has the best looking gpu's in my opinion.  The LED's look awesome in my case.  Looking forward to overclocking this in the future too.   ",5,GPU
"Love this card.  It was a huge pain to actually find one in stock, but I'm glad I waited for this one!  Mine was a later build, so it didn't have any issues with the plastic wrap being installed under the screws.  I think it's a great looking card even though some people don't like it as much.  Goes really well with a black and white build.  I haven't really overclocked it too much as I don't want to increase voltage, but without increasing voltage it's stable in the 1950mhz range.  Very fast!  I play in 4K and this thing handles everything at over 45fps or so.  In fallout 4 it stays locked to 60fps in Ultra settings at 4K for the most part.  I set a custom fan curve as out of the box it was a little conservative and let the GPU get to a little over 80 degrees.  The fans are very efficient and quiet, and with my custom fan curve it never gets above 77 or 78 degrees celcius and is still very quiet.  I wish this one had RGB lighting but that's the only negative I can think of, and if that's important to you I'd recommend stepping up to the FTW if you can find it in stock.  Overall I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a very fast card for 1440p or 4K gaming.  If you game at 1080P I would still recommend a GTX 1070.  Who knows, maybe in the (distant) future I'll pick up another one for SLI! :D ",5,GPU

"I originally was going to go with a GTX 980 ti but when I saw this on sale with $100 mail in rebate I had to get it. So I got the most powerful $500 GPU there is. If you want to game in  4k then you need more RAM. One thing that this GPU doesn't lack is RAM. I have been able to play most games at mid to high settings in 4k without have any issues. I have played Assassins Creed Syndicate, Alien Isolation, and Battlefield 4 on 1440 with all settings on Ultra. Settings vary in each game once I set the resolution to 4k. ",5,GPU
"Fastest low profile, single slot card in the US. ",4,GPU
"Really likes the looks of this card, not too ""gamery"" like other brands. The fans won't spin when idle and always below 65 degree Celsius under full load and overclocked. Performance wise, it's a decent gtx 1070 card with factory clocked however it's not that great when comes to overclocking. Do read this review before make the purchase  ",4,GPU
"A great GPU for the price I got it for (Like-new on Craigslist). Maybe worth an upgrade later on, but a great starting point. ",5,GPU
"Would have liked a better card, but this runs EVE Online at 60 FPS framecapped. Very smooth. ",4,GPU
"I've only tried the DOOM demo so far on Ultra, but it's amazing! ",5,GPU
"Great graphics card, run battlefield 4 with everything on Ultra. Also everything to max in Cities Skylines but that is easy. It struggles a bit with Total War Attila at Medium to High settings but apparently it is either the poor optimization of the game or the AMD driver is not up to snuff yet. I'll update this info in the future. ",4,GPU
GREAT video card. AMD sure knows how to make a GPU. My only issue is the TERRIBLE reference cooler. Had to buy a custom cooler to be able to live with it. That's the only reason for a 4-star rating in addition to the noticeable coil whine when setting the fan to a low RPM. ,4,GPU
"Got a decent deal on this on black friday and I really wont need more than 2GB. Its a stepping stone card that im just keeping until AMD's new line up comes out. Plays witcher on Ultra at a solid 40 fps which is a lot better than my previous one playing the game on low at 23 fps haha. I wanted to plasti-dip the shroud white so it matches the rest of the case but even when i unscrew everything the heatsink will not seperate from the bottom part of the gpu. I've tried like 3 times, I haven't missed any screws so I've just given up haha. If anyone has any advice though that would be great!  ",5,GPU
"Just arrived on New Year's Eve. Through Fire Strike tests, I have never seen it exceed 70c. Idles around 30-35c. Temps are great. Scored around 16.4k so far, have to find some time to finetune the OC as I was just messing around at first. Only complaints are that the tubing is a bit stiff. Made it difficult to attach the fan somewhere as it is difficult to bend. Also, the OC Guru software is kind of poorly designed, so you're better off using something better like MSI AfterBurner/EVGA PrecisionX ",4,GPU
This thing is awesome if you catch it for a good price used. May be old but it still runs all the games I want and they're all very playable. ,5,GPU
"This thing runs everything flawlessly on max settings in 1080.  Mine overclocks well (mileage my very).  Nvidia’s software is excellent.  Gigabyte’s software allows me to change the LEDs on the card to match my rig.  The only con I have is the price was a little high but being a brand new chip,  I understand the law of supply and demand. ",5,GPU
"This is the best budget card I've worked with, and possibly the best reference card I've used. For a blower card it is extremely quiet (note I say 'for a blower card', it's still louder and hotter than a proper AIB card) and I can't say I expected its level of performance for under $300. It handles large CAD projects and get a consistent 80+ FPS at 1440p on Ultra in games like RB6 Siege and other FPS's like it.  ",5,GPU
"I originally intended to recycle an old RADEON 4870X2 (C. 2008... yeah I know) but it had defects from age and heat, so I grabbed a small profile GTX 950 OC ed. from GIGABYTE. I realized from my research that the 950 was basically a down-clocked 960, so I figured that with the right software tuning I could restore the near 960 performance on the hardware. As I'm not intending to buy a 4k monitor at the moment, I'm more than satisfied with 1080P gaming, and this card is a true workhorse~!  Also very small, quiet and power efficient. Benchmarks surprisingly show that it out-competes the R7 370X.   UPDATE:  I have successfully overclocked the GTX 950 to a stable:  Base Clock of 1,289 MHz  (VS 1241 MHZ: GTX 960) Boost Clock of 1,466 MHz  (VS 1,304 MHZ: GTX 960) and a memory clock of 6834 MHz...  with NO other modification (power temp etc) The 4GB GDDR5 of the 960 does not provide a significant increase in gaming benchmarks, (although would be sorely missed if trying to run 2 cards in SLI) and the GTX 950 runs 30W/25% cooler than the 960. ",5,GPU
"kek, nvidia shafted me but its all good. 8/10 would buy again  ",4,GPU
"$275 is an incredible price for this and I'm glad I got this deal instead of the 480. I've honestly only played CSGO, Battlefield: BC2, and Dishonored so far, but it keeps all of them at my max framerate with the exception of occasional brief drops in BC2 (and freesync takes care of that). With less than 5 minutes in MSI Afterburner, I undervolted it and messed with fan speed settings, and it sat at or under 40C in Dishonored in about 2.5 hours of play. ",5,GPU
"Just like every other 980ti that's out there, it's just a reference card with a manufacturer overclock and flair. Performs about 10-15% better than the normal 980's I believe. Card is great looking, and fairly quiet.  You can hear the secondary fan spool up when needed depending on how bad you're hammering the card. For high steady loads, the sound is more tolerable and less noticeable as opposed to when the fan starts up from a dead stop.  ",5,GPU
"This card really exceeded my expectations! It plays every game I have at max settings 60FPS. I managed to OC it to 1275Mhz, and that gave it about 8-10 FPS more :) ",5,GPU
"Wow. This thing handles whatever you can throw at it (below 4k, that is) and overclocks like a beast. Mine stays below 70C too with my setup. ",5,GPU
"This card is amazing, especially with GPU Tweak II. Well worth it as a mid-range card. ",5,GPU
"Love this card its even better in SLI, out of this world performance to  ",5,GPU
Computes like a charm but still need better linux support. why no linux? ,4,GPU
"Can't emphasize how quiet this GPU is when is not under load.  It's literally inaudible! The fans only trigger if temp is above 60°C therefore, if you are not playing something 'heavy' it won't  make any sort of noise. Idle temperatures are sitting at 59/60°C. Don't know if it's associated with the factory overclock or not, but it differs from what I read in several review (33-39°C). Maybe, I lack the knowledge to optimize it properly (IF YOU HAVE ANY TIPS PM OR COMMENT) If If set GPU's fans in a 1:1 profile, idle temperatures sit around 43-46°C. In this scenario, you can definitely  hear the GPU but nothing outrageous. Just a slight ""humming"". Performance wise: Holy ****. Holy ****. I can ran Witcher 3 ultra settings/1440p with continuous 80-87 fps. At this stage the fans are too noisy for my standards. Nonetheless, I use open-back headphones and can't hear them on top of my music or games. Since this is a LARGE and VERY HEAVY card, there is a slight drop. Just make sure you mount it in a fashion that compensates the drop. Additionally, I manage to support it with my sleeved cable (notice how strategically I have put a zip tie around the cable and positioned them close to the case's base). I will find an alternative to provide some additional support. I will update this build when I find a decent solution. SLI? I dont know about this one. This stuff is so thick....but it will definitely fit but I would have concerns regarding airflow. I don't think this card would be a great choice if you need to SLI or plan to in the future. Unless...you use a PCI-E flexible extension cable. ",5,GPU
"Amazon had this factory overclocked card for $309 with a $20 mail in rebate, and also a free copy of The Division game! Had to grab it. This card is quiet, powerful and much more energy efficient than comparable Radeon cards. I contemplated going with the Radeon 380 instead but more power consumption = more power needed = more heat = bigger power supply = more airflow needed =more fans! Ill take the cost performance hit for the power/heat efficiency. BTW I havnt been able to throw anything at this GPU that it cant run at 60fps+ on ultra! Stable overclock from 1241 Mhz to 1410 Mhz. Core Tmax never exceeds 74C with case fans on lowest setting! Just for some perspective, Turbo on a reference GTX970 is 1150 Ghz!! Thats almost a 30% performance increase over a reference board! What a deal this card is! ",5,GPU
"What is there to say about the 980Ti? That is screams. When something costs significantly less for 3% less performance, jump on it. (Aside from Vram that is) Really impressed, and I have put it through its paces with everything I can throw at it. It is stable at 1444mhz, seeing as I am not really needing it for gaming primarily per se. ",5,GPU
"A little annoyed by the mini HDMI, didn't' realize it wasn't a full size but this should take care of running to monitors not for gaming. ",5,GPU
Great graphics card for the money! It keeps cool under full load and low tdp. Can run ARK at bare minimum and Minecraft maxed out with 50 or so mods.  ,5,GPU
"I don't play too many graphics-heavy games, so this card is pretty good for me. ",4,GPU
"I'm using this to game on 1080p at 60 FPS and works out awesome with two new features I'm in love with using, one of its features called  Virtual Super Resolution (VSR) ""Get quality that rivals 4K, even on a 1080p display, designed to automatically re-render games at higher resolutions and dynamically rescale them for HD displays at higher quality and visual details."" Then there is Frame Rate Target Control (FRTC) ""Fine-tune your graphics with real-time frame rate control limiting the target frame rate during gameplay, reducing GPU power consumption."" I can keep games at a low 60FPS as my 1080p 40'' TV isn't the best 60Hz out there ",5,GPU
Decent video card. Was meant to play light 3D and 2D games. Had to remove the fans in order to install because the space next to the PSU is extremely tight. ,3,GPU
It is a very powerful GPU for a 2GB card. I can run BF4 on ultra settings and still get 50-90 FPS online.  -_- Monitor is only 60Hz... LOL ,5,GPU
"Good enough, might upgrade in the future but is eons better than my intel mobile graphics for my laptop XD ",5,GPU
Found this open box at microcenter for $160...I grabbed it like it was a crime. I cant imagine another card being better for $160. I will not be buying a monitor and I use this PC on my 1080p TV so 4k gaming is not a dream of mine. And in the future If i have $1000 for a 4k tv im sure I could afford another $300 for a GPU...but I have played Battlefield and Call of Duty on this card so far at mostly utlra settings and have not had a hiccup or any issues. Usally hovering around 50-70 fps. Nice.  ,4,GPU
good gpu for the price. I could not find a better priced new gpu at the time when I purchased this. I can play most games on max settings.  ,5,GPU
"This GPU, along with being damn near silent, can run everything maxed out... without breaking a sweat. Many times have I been impressed simply by running a game and seeing the FPS-Counter hit the three hundred mark. Given these titles may not be Triple A, but, it still amazes me.  ",5,GPU
It a good card for Retro and light gaming ,3,GPU
"I  had a bit of an issue with the temperature on these as I had them both right beside each other because I thought the space in my case wouldn't let me have them apart. Turns out I can just barely fit one lower down, fixed the temperatures on the cards but now my SSD runs a little hot, it's within acceptable ranges though! The cards themselves perform amazingly, there isn't a game I've tried where having maxed out settings brings the framerate below 60. I tend to keep AA and those types of things off because I don't really notice any difference between the setting being on or not, when those settings are off I haven't seen games dip below 100 except where they're locked!

"This little guy is awesome. Super easy to install (maybe 5 minutes?). Got the latest drivers from Nvidia, and it works awesome! My FPS on Novabench tests went from 500FPS with integrated skylake graphics, to 2450 with the GTX. Very noticeable. If you are worried about size, this is your GTX 960. At like 6 inches, it fit like a charm into my Mini ITX case. Love it to pieces.  ",5,GPU

"Despite the 3.5 GB controversy, I still decided to get this card and I have not been let down yet.  It runs every game I play extremely smoothly, and it also has the revised ACX 2.0 cooler design, so that's nice. ",5,GPU
I own a Gigabyte 970 Windforce and feel that this 750ti is still better than most of the offerings out there. This card is in my computer even after I bought the 970 and it powers through modern games at 60fps with AA off which is amazing considering this only draws 65W at load. ,5,GPU
"Wonderful video card, runs hot but doesn't go above the 80 Degrees even at full load. Impressed since Founders tend to run hotter, but they are more robust as well. ",5,GPU
"Entry-level game performer. Perfect for an all-around rig that will be used for a lot of things. Will give you enough gaming performance that will be tolerable for short spurts on modern demanding games. Will do great on 720p gaming high settings for older titles. 4-stars because, well spend a few more bucks and you can get a GTX 950 or the 4GB version of this card. ",4,GPU
"This is a great card. It runs cool (21 degrees Celsius idle, and 50 degrees while playing RYSE for a long time), it is silent, and gives 60 fps 95% of the time, on everything high/ultra (with supersampling not active). It is a huge card though. For 1080p gaming it works really well, no hint of any struggling. ",5,GPU
"Does it's job, operates at a good temperature. ",4,GPU
"run 3 1080p monitors, and n the stock bios in never makes a noise! (not over the sound of my case fans at least) though I changed the fan curve to keep my whole case cooler, since the fans didnt turn on til 60 C. Which the fan are very powerful and when stress testing my system the fans can get loud but i have not gotten my card to its 80 C ceiling yet.  ",5,GPU
Really love this graphics card. Inside my Lian-Li PC-08 case it idles at 28-30 degrees and at full load typically hovers at around 40 degrees. My only grip is that I couldn't replace the stock EVGA fan because it uses a 3-pin which connects to the pump of the GPU. The fans in my case are all PWM 4-pin fans :( ,5,GPU
This thing handles every game I throw at it (though to be fair I don't play too many high-end titles.) ,5,GPU
"The only games I have that didn't run at full graphics were Advanced Warfare and Minecraft's maximum render distance. Great for basic gaming at 1080p 60FPS. Lately I've noticed it's starting to sag in my case, I guess the weight is more than the card's support. Also the left fan has been clicking on occasion as of late. No coil whine and never gets FPS drops. Temps even at full stress only peak 70 degrees. ",4,GPU
"ASUS makes a lot of claims about this GPU... they are all true. You may have your personal preferences for a certain manufacturer, and that's fine, but this card will definitely earn anyone's respect. This card will definitely set a benchmark among GTX 980 ti cards. And I'm really happy with it. ",5,GPU
"I have to say this is a solid little card! Using only one fan for cooling and a heat sink half the size of that of a full card this gets up to 71 degrees whilst gaming, boost clock goes all the way to 1.2GHz. Got it because it was only £120 (I'm extremely salty about U.S. GPU prices.) Not sure about overclock potential for the aforementioned cooling reasons, but it runs well for 1080p budget gaming. Score of 4982 on Passmark PerformanceTest 8.0. ",4,GPU
"Good mid-range GPU for 1080p gaming, though if you want to play VR games, this card can't and you'll at least need a GTX 970. Paired with my i3-6100, I can play games like GTA V & online, Rainbow Six Siege, The Divison & remastered Skyrim on Ultra 1080p with high FPS with no problem. Cool customizable RGB lighting. Easily OC'ed to 1596MHz. ",5,GPU
"Now this thing is not going to be good for 4k gaming let me start with that. HOWEVER, if you play games like CS:GO , Osu!, League of Legends, and Rocket League on a 1920x1080 monitor,  this is more than enough. I overclocked my card to the point at which I match VR Spec through 3DMark's Cloud Gate Benchmark, (  ",5,GPU

"Great card, was able to safely overclock to around 1560mhz and it didn't even get hotter than 75 degrees C and was benchmarking an average of 60fps on ultra 1080p setting for Heaven Benchmark.  ",5,GPU
"Oh God. Where to get started. This GPU is absolutely mind blowing. You hear about how awsome th gtx 1080 is with its ultra high end specs, but I really wasn't expecting how well this variant performed temperature  and noise wise. I also really like the led logo on the backplate: it looks pretty sick! ",5,GPU
"Said ""eh"" to my initial budget and went with the 390. With 8gb of RAM I can max out the settings on most games. (GTA goes up to 6 gigs). Looks amazing can't wait to try it out with some of the planned releases! ",5,GPU
"Not exactly the greatest, but is good if you need extra display ports. I use this in dual graphics (with an A6-6400K) and I'm not entirely sure if its just me, but I really feel as if there is an improvement in performance (not big, but not small either). Either way, I was probably better off getting a better GPU and ignoring dual graphics overall. Still good imo. ",4,GPU
"The Asus GTX750 is only running a 1600x900 monitor and a 720p tv, but it seems to handle that pretty effortlessly. Most games I can run at max settings or one notch below, with v-sync off. Everything short of stress testing, I can barely hear the fan running. When I’m not gaming, then I don’t hear it at all. I will eventually be looking to upgrade to a GTX960 later this year. I’m looking at one of these 2: or possibly this one, if the extra 2GB are worth the extra money: Any recommendations? ",5,GPU
"Bought this used through a Craigslist ad, was listed as the FTW edition, but is a slightly lower clocked Best Buy model. Plenty of pep and horsepower to drive games at my monitors native resolution (1680x1050) at medium to high settings, works for me. Only knock against the card is the fans do not go below 42%, even when the system is at idle and that's kinda frustrating. ",4,GPU
"The 780Ti is a beast of a card, is faster than the 780, is one of the fastest GPU’s available, and is a gorgeous piece of tech. I chose EVGA because of their excellent warranty and the stock cooling is excellent as is and looks amazing. I considered a 290 and 290X but the AMD cards run hot and were very expensive at the time of my purchase thanks to their demand by the bit coin miners. I also didn’t want to have to get aftermarket cooling on a video card that should have had a better stock cooling solution to begin with. On top of all that I remembered also remembered the problems I had with drivers from ATI/AMD with a few of their cards I purchased in the past. I picked up a back plate for the card from EVGA for looks, to add rigidity, and to help a bit with cooling. The back plate was easy to install and adds more style to an already amazing GPU. ",5,GPU
Good price to performance when brought but now not as much due to Nvidia has released the 900 series.  ,4,GPU

"One the best GPUs for 1080p Gaming. (Also decent for 1440p) On par with Nvidia's GTX 1060. Can utilize AMD's Freesync Technology. (You obviously need a Freesync ready monitor) Performance is great out-of the box, with a decent factory Overclock. You can easily OC yourself using MSI Afterburner or AMD Wattman.  Runs pretty cool and quiet thanks to MSI's Twin Frozr Fans. Fans doesn't start spinning until the GPU hits 60°c.

Oct 9, 2014 There is also a great forum thread on  I have to say at the beginning release of this card there were many complaints about the drivers crashing or not being compatible. As of Nov 2014 I have had ZERO issues with the card overheating, crashing, BSOD...etc. This card has been used 8-12 hours straight while streaming to twitch without any coil whine, overheating, crashing or slowing down in BF4, Evolve, Heroes of the Storm etc. I am sure some of that was true at one time but not anymore. Please ask any questions you would like. I am so excited about this thing I love talking about it. Overclocking is easy and transparent.
Downloaded the easy to find drivers within minutes and I was playing BF4 on Ultra (EVERYTHING) with consistent 60fps! sometimes more. **I have since over clocked this thing like crazygaining almost 15-20% more raw power than the reference AMD R9 290 and about 10% more than the card out of the box. Here are great reviews showing actual testing. Look up the review from 2014 by Sanjin Rados on 2014. Great review look up the review on overlockers by Humbug in APR of 2014 I have almost exactly similar specs to the 2nd review. I have less experience over clocking than both the reviewers and I learned a LOT.  I REALLY want to emphasize just how EASY overclocking this card has been. The 3 star rating is underserved and I hope many of you take the time, that I did, and really try to read thru the stuff that most people post on here and give this card a bad review.*  ",5,GPU

"Great entry level card for $299.00.  Temps at idle 33'c between 60'c and 70'c when gaming on ultra settings..Nothing really to compare it to except my late 2014 27' iMac 5k retina with 3.5 GHz i5 and, 2GB AMD Radeon R9 M290X. The GTX 1060 performs much better. Graphics are crisp on 1920 x 1080  but, I'll be able to tell more when I get a monitor that preforms like the 5k retina display. ",5,GPU
Extremely snappy. ,5,GPU
A high end budget gpu from AMD. This Sapphire VaporX edition can get fairly loud when running at full speeds but it keeps the card cooled. ,4,GPU
"So I got this GPU because it was a steal at $130, and was a little better than the GTX 950 SSC from EVGA. Plus, it's got a noticable increase in CUDA cores over the 950. All in all, I wouldn't recommend it because it's simply not available. Or, if it is, its MSRP is $410. Don't do it unless you were in my exact circumstance, which I doubt you are. Since this is also my first build, I don't have much to compare it with besides reading specs. ",4,GPU
"What else is there to say about this card? It blows newer games like Far Cry 4 out of the water, and runs very cool and quiet while doing so. The only bummer is the clear sticker on the side that reads ""GeForce GTX 980"" was ripped on arrival. Its a bummer because the sticker is backlit - its meant to be a nice physical feature showing off the card, but now it just accentuates the rip! ",5,GPU
"For the money, power and heat, best upper mid range card you buy, Direct X 12 full future support also being key. If you want you budget build to be future proof, obviously go with an R9  290+ or equivalent card, but the heat, cost and power requirements obviousness  alter the entire build. This  was my trade off, but with new chips coming out this year, no need to buy old stuff yet. ",4,GPU
Plenty of power and I like the Vram for the future. Could easily run a single 1440 monitor. ,5,GPU
"Great for my needs. It's quiet, low energy, efficient and high performing. ",5,GPU
"According to Nvidia this is the 1080p sweet spot card.  Prior to games like GTA V I would have agreed.  I think its a great card to play any 1080p game at 60 fps but the 2gb VRAM is holding it back.  They make 4 GB versions and those seem to be a better buy upon first glance, but if you look over to the AMD side of things those cards for the same price out perform it.  If you have to go Nvidia this is a good card.  I went with it because I got a great deal on it. ",4,GPU
,5,GPU
"I honestly don't know a whole lot about GPU's.. but a friend of mine suggested this GPU to me. After mail in rebate and an instant discount, the cost was $168 compared to $200. Seems like a pretty good deal to me and it has 4GB of RAM. I was told this can run most games these days on high settings, but I could be wrong. ",5,GPU
"I love the 750ti. Super cool running, quiet, and still powerful. My card is missing a fan blade, but I saved a bit on the price, and doesn't affect performance drastically.  ",5,GPU
"I love this GTX. Yes, it is old and needs a little bit of juice with two PCIE. It runs games like BF4 and Fallout 4 no problem on High at good FPS ",4,GPU
The fans are stopping when not in use. Very nice feature. The only con of this card is it doesnt support SLI ,4,GPU
"I haven't found anything that can really push this video card to its limits, but it runs all my games great. I can stream with OBS in 720p at 1600kbps without dropping a lot of frames. My only complaint is that it doesn't push a true 1366x768 signal to my second monitor, a Vizio VW32L TV. My TV always interprets the video card's signal as 1080p, which the TV is not. So that monitor's image is upscaled to 1080p by the video card then scaled back down to 1366x768 by the TV itself. My old computer's various Nvidia cards all had no problem giving this TV an acceptable 1366x768 signal. ",4,GPU
"Not super high-end, Not the performance per dollar champion like maybe a 970 would be. But for $200 I feel like this really takes the cake in it's price bracket  ",4,GPU
"750 Ti is the best price/performance/ power card imo. Great!
Can run Battlefield 3 on high at 45-60 fps, Bioshock infinite on Highest with 30-50 fps. ",5,GPU
"This card is the greatest thing ever. It runs all my games beautifully, it can handle those 1080p, 60fps YouTube videos my laptop melted trying to run, and it has a whopping 4 gigabytes of video memory. Can I add 6 stars, please? ",5,GPU
This was By Far the Best buy in My whole system this is a great Card Fast Silent and Plenty of VRAM for mods and Eventually 4k ( If I Get a 4k Monitor Idk) I picked it up extremely cheap on one of Mwaves Group deals. I am Very Happy with this Purchase ,5,GPU
"Quiet, cool, 6 pinless Geforce GTX 950 that performs identically to the 90w version.  Haven't tested the OC capability but didn't need it.  If you are in the market for this type of card I highly recommend it. ",5,GPU
"This isn't just some basic factory overclocked card. It's got an amazing cooler on it to keep that overclock cool and stable, and it has the memory overclocked generously compared to other cards out there which only really upgrade the GPU clocks. The factory power delivery increase is also helpful in all of this. ",5,GPU
"$260 (the price when I wrote this) will get you a GTX 1060, which is way better. If you really want a 960, wait for it to drop to $200. (Rating is based on the $200 price, not whatever it currently is.) ",5,GPU
"The card is decent, but I'm giving it 1 star for how ****** PNY's customer service is, AND the fact it has a ******* mini HDMI port. plus you have to push up on the port for the monitor to display since of some problem with sag. ",1,GPU
Wow great Quality! $140 up grade. If i didn't do it i would have second guessed myself and would be pissed. Hope to learn how to get the most out of them. ,5,GPU
"Despite the controversy with the VRAM, these cards have performed very well for me. I have screenshots of benchmarks on my build page. I can see how using a single card may pose issues though. So, in SLI, you will easily max out most games at 1080p and achieve 60+ fps.  ",5,GPU
"Works well for my needs, installed nicely easily, runs cool.  Friend's GTX 760 outscored it on 2D graphics though... ",4,GPU
Before you go off at me and tell me I should've got and AMD card I'm and NVidia fan and I love this graphic card. Goes well with my CPU. (Intel i3-4150) ,5,GPU
Great graphics card havent been playing to many hard core games but I was playing sniper 2 and it was staying in the 90s at the highest settings. I like how the fans dont spin on until it hits a certain degree. I also really like the back-plate making it stronger. I also got it for an amazing price ,4,GPU
"Fast, quiet, and great looking card.  It comes with a backplate with is a huge plus as well. ",5,GPU
"Plays the games I want (mostly titles from a couple years ago) at high settings, 1080p. ",5,GPU
"Really Powerfull card! Benchmarks amazingly! It has plenty of places where you can grip it so installing it wasnt too difficult. I suspect this card will do great when it comes time to dual gpu the card. Also it has TOONS of outputs, and nice little caps for each port.
Oh and I did make a mistake when installing I thought i could completely intall it and remove the plastic wrap later (that way i made sure it was nice an shiny), however you can only remove it when it is out of its slot. ",5,GPU
"Nothing stops this monster. I especially love how many ports I have in the back. 3 display ports, 1 hdmi, and 1 dvi. Just ridiculous. It works without a hesitation. ",5,GPU
"This Card definitely holds its own, gaming, music creation, or otherwise. It's perfect.
Even with just 1. ",5,GPU
Fast and quiet. Not enough testing yet but am pleased with this so far.  ,5,GPU
An expenisve GPU but well worth the price. Fans are automatically tuned to correspond with the heat of the GPU and the clock speeds this thing gets are amazing. Only thing is this card requires 2 6 pin power connectors so keep that in mind and get the appropriate PSU ,4,GPU
"Poor overclocker compared to other models of the GTX 760, bad coil whine, and fans are extremely loud (and high pitched) when the card is under load. If you value a quiet gaming environment, you're either gonna need to lower the GPU load (i.e. waste potential performance) by capping framerate or underclocking, or look for a quieter model. Very unstable when attempting to overclock the memory, could barely push it to 6400MHz, while most others will reach around 6800MHz (i.e. twice the gain compared to stock). ",2,GPU
"Great older GPU. Doesn't handle overclocking very well, but after cleaning, reapplying thermal paste and tweaking it performs much bettet than the GTX 760 it replaced. Yay for old free hardware. ",5,GPU
"This is a perfect graphics card for this build because you can overclock it, which gives extra performance and because of its cheap price point its great. As an added bonus it has two gigabytes of gddr5 memory. ",4,GPU
"Best bang for the buck, love it ",5,GPU
A little powerhouse that pairs very well with my i3 Skylake. There is a firmware update that took care of some random fan spinning up issues I was seeing.. ,5,GPU
"For $120, this GPU is fantastic, it is quiet and it is a powerful GPU, it handles everything we have thrown at it at 1080p at high or ultra. ",5,GPU
"This thing. This monster. It's a beast, and very hard to get a hold of. It is totally wizard, Anni! ",5,GPU
Graphics Card: At the time there wasn't any custom cooled GFX cards like the Red Devil so i bought amd original fan cooler (eeew) i bought it in the 17th of July. ps: if the 1060 was out i would have bought it. Bought in Europe. ,4,GPU
"For the money, it has been a good substitute until I can afford a decent GPU. It has also handled a stable overclock using Afterburner +150MHz core clock and +100MHz memory. ",3,GPU
"Got this card on sale for 200$ off, and its a very good card, handles all the games I play right now with ease at 1080p ",5,GPU
Never expected to find one this cheap and thought it too good to be true. I now own it and wow this thing is beautiful and amazing. Freaking huge as well. ,5,GPU
Faster than a Titan X and is very quiet compared to others. Has water cooling built in so that I can plug and play vs buying a block down the road and already boosts to 1520 without touching voltage so I'm happy.  ,5,GPU
"If you are like me and only use  1 IPS  22"", then this guy is all you need.  Quality seems to be fine, although rest of system could handle quality graphics so this is really used as a source for input.  For $40.00 why not. ",5,GPU
"Did some light gaming with this in another build for 6 months and liked it pretty well. Now it's mostly retired to the life of Riley as the gpu for a backup/htpc build that also gets used for some light web browsing. For this use it's great, and the fanless silent cooling makes the build quiet as a whisper. I can barely tell it's running when I'm right next to it. For anyone looking for a silent gpu on the cheap for an htpc build or to get a build up and running for cheap, this one is your budget model. It's pretty small for a fanless card and should fit fairly easily into almost any build, and requires almost no power. ",4,GPU
Hella expensive but hella fast and hella good looking ,5,GPU
the cutest gpu in the universe. spared me the trouble of having to fit a full-size gpu in the thermaltake core v1. 1080p kneels before this mighty card ,5,GPU
IT'S  A WHITE GPU! BUY IT ALREADY! ,5,GPU
"I actually wanna give this card 10 stars. Like. It's looks great with it's stock cooler, and runs really cool with it, but for the enthusiast its even better! Being reference design it's compatbile with a lot of nice waterblocks and the screws weren't torx, they where PHILIPS! THANK YOU ZOTAC. One thing they gotta do though is increase the thread side of their backplate to improve compatability with waterblocks though. But yeah these cards are fricken monsters. ",5,GPU
"For the same price as my old Radeon R5-220, this GPU works at least twice as well. I used to not be able to play Robocraft at all on the fastest settings on my old PC, but it works great on good settings now. (The GOOD quality setting is 4 out of 6 in Robocraft, 6 being best.) ",5,GPU
"Phenomenal card. For any user that prefers not to spend the $900+ for a Titan X, this card has the performance of it, with a more realistic ceiling. Not one single complaint. ",5,GPU
"Silent, over clocks like a champion, runs everything I throw at it in 2560x1080. Fantastic card and looks sick as hell. Comes with a nice solid backplate and a custom black PCB. All this makes the card a joy to own. ",5,GPU
XTREME GAMING MUCH FAST VERY WOW ,5,GPU
Got this for $50 very lightly used from a friend and it works great ,5,GPU
i enjoy having this card.  the one thing i have noticed is that this card doesn't overclock well even with the two 6-pin pci power connectors.  i don't know if i have a bad card or just a bad overclock.  for the price that i payed $120ish i guess i get what i payed for.  with that said i do plan on getting another R9 270 for crossfire (cheapest solution) ,3,GPU
"Great GPU! I had a few problems but then I figured out it was because my drivers were not installed right, so it was my fault. ",5,GPU
"Great card for the price, to bad no crossfire support for ubuntu... ",4,GPU
"I know this is a really cheap card but I love it because it is tiny and it sips wattage. In the past 18 months (in this order) I have had the following in my rigs: HD 6450 1gb, GTX 750 SC 1gb, r9 280x 3gb, GTX 450 1gb, GTX 580 1.5gb, HD 7850 1gb, and finally the GTX 950. The only card I bought new was the 750. Everything else has been bought used off Craigslist or Ebay and usually sold later for a profit ( except the 280x, it was stolen ). Out of all the cards this has been my favorite and is pretty close to the 280x in performance. But costs less, is way smaller/cooler and uses less watts. ",5,GPU
"Personally this is a good overclockable card, doesn't lag or loose frames in most games, over clocks like a champion, pretty smooth and easy. Only downside is AMD drivers kinda suck, but other then that, this is a perfect card for decent performance ",5,GPU
It's a potato. You cannot play any game at any decent framerates even with a FX-8320. ,2,GPU
"I didn't want to skimp on performance but, most importantly stability.  I also didn't want to have a large card making a lot of heat and sucking a lot of power. I am already running a power hungry CPU, and didn't want to add too much to that. The slim and elegant design means I still have access to the other expansion card slots, and it doesn't obstruct the airflow in the case too much. The maximum power consumption for the card is 150W. It has 4 display port 1.2 connectors and a stereoscopic 3-pin din, for active 3D and high-end monitors. I'll really have to get a new 4K display to test out this card; but, it works great with my  dual 1080p setup, and everything looks a little... shinier. The only drawback so far is the annoying whine when its tiny fan really gets going. ",4,GPU
"The Graphics Card is well made, the Cooling fans seem weak, and after a year there are clear graphical glitches occurring after prolonged high use.
--Update: nearing 1 1/2 years of using this card and it is nearly gone. Still running fine but graphical issues continue to grow weaker with every passing day ",3,GPU
"Huge card, just barely fits in a Core V1, but thats not a bad thing. Overclocks well. Manually turning the fan up keeps this thing more than cool, even while way overclocked. Noticed 2 single frame artifacts so far, about a week apart, while not overclocked. None this week (3rd week of ownership). Easily plays minecraft with shaders and 32 bit texture pack + 9 blocks render distance, overclock to 16 blocks render distance smoothly. ",4,GPU
"Very good card, okay shroud. The fans are loud even at 60%. However, temperatures are good, capping at 77 degrees Celsius in FurMark. I have overclocked to 1100 MHz and am continuing slowly. ",4,GPU
Best card for the price per performance. Runs a little hot but the Vapor x handles it well.  ,5,GPU
Oh boy. This thing plows through games like a champ. I love how many filters I can fit into that 4gb. I've had this card for about a year now. I really have no real qualms. ,5,GPU
"I could not be more pleased with this GPU. It handles BF4 on high settings. It does have an obvious ceiling, and when I push ultra level graphics it does drop to 30 or so FPS, but for the super low price it is compared to other GPU's these days, this card is a steal. Glad I got it for my first go round building a PC and even if I upgrade my GPU ill probably keep using it in some capacity till it dies or is phased out of compatibility.   ",4,GPU
"This card hardly breaks a sweat on whatever game I throw at it! I'm currently gaming at 1900 x 1200 at 60 Hz, and the GPU has yet to kick its fan above ~55%. It's making me want to upgrade my monitor sooner. ",5,GPU
"All I can say is, for $259 this card was a steal! Its an R9 Fury, what more can you ask for, its a great overall card. ",5,GPU
"LOVE this GPU. Fast for what I need, and has overclocked like a dream while staying quiet and cool (With a custom fan curve set in Afterburner)! 60+FPS in Saints Row: The Third, 140+FPS in Far Cry 2, 90 FPS In Skyrim, all on ultra settings 1920x1080. ",5,GPU
"Picked it up on Kijiji for a steal with the Dual Monitors (1680x1050) for $150 CAD for the pair. Basically a 950 with a real 2 GB. Only issue is it seems to over thrash when running any games outside windowed mode. Windowed mode will play all day long but in Full Screen will give a driver detachment BS error. I attribute it to drivers so far, but customer seems satisfied we found a bypass. This will be replaced with the MSI R9 380 (which will be the R(ed)part) Shortly as he is selling this to his friend who is also building a personal rig. ",4,GPU
"I don't believe you can get better for it's price.
Had no trouble installing and it's really fast, I've also never had it go above 64 degrees c. Very fast and only trouble was the 15.6 driver erroring while playing minecraft. ",4,GPU
This card was great value per dollar when it was new. It runs HOT and the fan gets screaming loud as temperatures increase. ,4,GPU
"July of 2016, all the new GPUs are being released and this old timer of a flagship is getting left in the dust.... or is it? This card is great for 1080p for a 3 year old card. I think it still deserves recognition for its tier. For $160 at Microcenter, it was a steal. I highly recommend picking up for cheap if you find one. ",5,GPU
"Overheats sometimes whilst gaming, but performs good enough for some 1080p gaming. ",3,GPU
"PCPP does not have the specific model listed on the site, PN: 12 02G-P4-1953-KR

Cool and compact - fit a tiny itx case painlessly and so far, quietly.... only tested Skyrim (Ultra HD with AA off etc)  which played fluidly at 1080p, which is what my system is geared for, and the 4 GB of VRAM helps with those HD textures, a lot... On the software side, if you're not using , or display doesn't support HDMI audio, I'd recommend not / uninstalling the HD Audio Driver from NVidia, as it clashed with my system's onboard audio...

"Went with the reference clock version, which is more than enough power. In 1440p, I'm averaging about 100 FPS in Black Ops 3 (1x Filmic SMAA) and 130 FPS in Star Wars Battlefront (FXAA High). The ACX 2.0+ cooler is doing a great job. The EVGA software doesn't look quite as polished as MSI's, but it allows simple overclocking and easy fan speed control so I can't really ask for anything else.  ",5,GPU
I am amazingly impressed with this card. I was pretty happy with it before I learned how to overclock (MSI afterburner) but then when I ramped it up I was amazed. Crysis 3 and ACBF both run at max textures with high AA in the 30fps range. Only complaint is that the fans are rather loud above 65% ,5,GPU

"I chose this card for 10 bit color and low power consumption for photography and video edit use. My whole i7-6700 based PC uses  a total of 20W at idle using the W4300. The  W4300  contributes about 10W of this power this at idle (at 2560 X 1400 resolution at 75Hz). I have run load tests using PRIME95 to stress CPU where total PC uses about 125W under full CPU load. Using Performance Test 8, as expected the W4300 is not up to the best retail game cards in 3D but is equal or better than the top game cards in 2D (which is what I was looking for) Eg. Performance Test 8 2D Graphic Mark score is 910 vs GTX 980 at 894 and 3D Graphics Mark 3007 vs GTX 980 of 10341. However the W4300 excels in some 2D areas Eg Graphics 2D - Direct 2D at 54.6 vs GTX 980 at 28.5. Other areas are comparable Eg Graphics 2D - Complex Vectors 1590.6 vs GTX 980 at 155.2 ",5,GPU
I have yet to jump into any games with this card but for $15 more than the 2GB 960 by Zotac and solid reviews all around I went for it. Basically this is an all around solid card for the build specs and cost and allows me plenty of room to appreciate the next gen cards whenever they decide to make an appearance. I do like that the fans don't spin up unless necessary keeping the build even quieter if I swap in a better cooler and replace the single case fan. This card can be OC'd but it doesn't appear to make much of a difference for the games I play. It does cover the first PCI x4 slot on the motherboard but I don't plan to use that anyways. Will report back later if there are issues. ,4,GPU

"I went with a GTX 780, and handled pretty much anything I threw at it maxed out at 1080p. It should also help out with future proofing, as I don't plan on upgrading this for a fairly long time.

I've been using Nvidia GPUs since even before the GeForce days when I had an HP computer with a TNT2 graphics card and haven't had any issues with them since. It turned out that it was a good move to use an Nvidia card when wanting to have a Hackintosh so bonus for that.  ",5,GPU
"$270 has never been more worth it. Plays games super well at 1080p. Pretty mediocre OC on my card however, but I usually leave it at stock. ",5,GPU
Still in the top three after four years this flagship video card is still worth buying.  Hard to upgrade from this without going broke. ,5,GPU
Very good card for the money. ,5,GPU
If you don't do hardcore gaming (Or almost any gaming for that matter) then this is OK. But it only has GDDR3 RAM which is slower. ,3,GPU
So I got this GPU back when Watchdog released which was around last March or May whatever. The reason why I got this was because the GPU price alone was $190... That was a steal that I could not let up haha. Overall great card and can push out performance. ,5,GPU
"Got this card for $240. All other r9 290s were over $300. Looks Great, Runs Great so far. I get 60+ FPS every game that I played (h1z1, ESO, Skyrim, CS:GO)...  Temps Run around 65-80 Degrees. Depending on the length of the gaming session. Solid GPU. Def good for the price. Now I want a Titan :) ",5,GPU
"Amazing cards - everyone knows how great the 980 Ti is, and EVGA slapped these fantastic AIO loops on them to keep them extra cool and stable. The packaging and documentation is premium all the way - EVGA knows they've got a good thing here. Two of these in SLI is blowing through every game I've tried so far at the highest settings I can manage with insane fps. The only issue is getting a good case set-up worked out for the 120mm radiator/fan mounts. ",5,GPU
"I love this card! It overclocks extremely well and plays every game I want at 60Hz, all settings maxed out. Upscaling to 1440p in some games is actually a more efficient alternative to AA, which is interesting. the idle temps are relatively high because of the custom fan curve I have. It does not turn on the fans until at least 60C, so I can play minecraft in solitude. My only complaint is how loud it is when the fans spin up! Once it gets to about 60% speed it's obnoxious.  ",4,GPU
"Amazing card for both 1080p and 1440p gaming. Spending anymore on a card for 1080p is just asinine. Don't brag about your 144hz 1080p monitor and gtx 980 ti because that's just cringe worthy. Who cares about 100+fps when you have very little pixels and the game doesn't even hinge itself on a single frame killing you or not.  Unless the game is DOTA, LoL, CS, and the like then it's not very beneficial other than massaging your ego and wasting money on the most average of resolutions. This card can do anything you want it to at any resolution.  People are just too proud to turn one setting down that barely changes anything. This fits my NEEDS not my epeen.  ",5,GPU
"Absolutely beautiful, literally my dream card in terms of aesthetics. Got it to hit a max clock of 2,076 which seems absurd to me since I never had a high end system. Would recommend to anyone. ",5,GPU
"Runs all my games on ultra 60+ fps, visually appealing, nice backplate ",5,GPU
"Very fast card, though the price seems a bit high given that it's essentially the same architecture as the R9 290X. That said, they improved the silicon and it overclocks much more readily. Was able to push mine to 1150 Mhz core clock / 1600 memory without needing to adjust voltage. With the OC, my benchmarking is essentially matching the stock Geforce GTX 980 for about half the cost.  ",4,GPU
Just got this GPU a week ago and it works great maxes out all the settings of the games I play ,5,GPU
An excellent card - too bad I bought this two days before the announcement of the RX480.  ,5,GPU
"The GTX 960 is at the best price/feature point among all Nvidia cards and excellent for CUDA development (1024 cuda cores). This is a factory-overclocked card, which is a plus. We did not consider ATI for obvious reasons. One card we disable on xorg.conf for CUDA development and the other for X work. Under windows we can play Battlefield under SLI at full speed. ",4,GPU
"You get an awful lot of card for your money. 1632 core clock, supposedly 1835 boost, but when running Unigine Valley I get 2037 MHz straight out of the box without changing any settings (Palit's own Thunder Master software also reports 2037 MHz - it isn't Unigine inflating the true value). With Unigine Valley running the card reaches 68C and 34% fan speed, which is enough to be audible, but is impressively quiet for a graphics card of this power. The card is huge. 300 long including the I/O shield (board length is 285) x 133 x 57 thick. Don't consider this card unless you have the thickness of 3 slots available (you don't physically need three slots in the case), and also be very wary of the 133 dimension if you have a small case - you've got to fit the power connector on top of that, remember. Because it is so cheap, and very quiet when new I'm happy to give it five stars, but I do have just a little reservation. If you manually turn the fans up to full they are very noisy indeed and I suspect that over time as dust collects on surfaces reducing heat transfer, the fans will need to work harder and  the card will become louder. I'll just have to wait and see. ",5,GPU
"I love that it uses little power, and I got an amazing deal on it. I’m also done with Radeon cards. I’ve used Radeon cards since 2007, and the drivers are awful. No more. So far super-quiet and runs all the games I play, which aren't graphically-intensive. ",5,GPU
"Fantastic card. I've had it for 18 months now and i've not had any issues with the card or drivers. Always performs well and i've been able to play most games on ultra at 1440 and I've not had any issues with 4gb HBM. It's always cool and quiet, but can be a pain getting the fan/radiator placement right along with my CPU cooler, but once it's setup i've not seen it go above the mid 50s. ",5,GPU
"Great card, runs most games at maxed out settings. ",5,GPU
Looks awesome and goes well with the build also the fans will speed 100% if you press the button at the back of the card and it will be loud. ,5,GPU
"Amazing card, price is reasonable, performance is exceptional. runs every game i throw at it.  ",5,GPU
"For my gaming in full HD, this is more than sufficient. High settings and sometimes Ultra gives me decent 30-60fps. Although not much difference with 2GB model, I think I've overspent in this area. For Full HD gaming I recommend go up to R9 model. ",3,GPU
"terrific card need I say more, the best selling card in market as of jan 2016 ",5,GPU
"Runs at 75C as advertised, playing 1440p 144hz ",5,GPU
"Works fine, but I got it a month before gtx970 went out and I would really prefer that one over this (its more powerful than gtx770 with similar price range).  ",4,GPU
Beast of a machine in a tiny package.  These were 500+ a few months ago and now down to 375.  Bests a 980 in a TINY form factor.  ,5,GPU
"This GPU is part of a dying niche. You shouldn't be buying one for newer computers, since it's not really better than today's Intel HD Graphics, and costs too much money to be worth it. For an older computer, however, it's a decent way to get more performance. The GT 710 kicks the snot out of older Intel GMA graphics, and the difference is actually visible in day to day usage. ",4,GPU
the 270x direct CU II TOP edition from Asus is awesome. it provides good fps per $ and has good heat spred. i would recommend getting an outtake fan or 2 becuase it dispatches heat into outside the gpu into the case ,5,GPU
"Given that I got it basically at a steal, it's working amazing. Definitely better than my old 750 Ti, that's for sure. The temps are a bit hot but the backplate is definitely hot, but you wont be touching that so it wont matter. ",4,GPU
"This GPU works wonders, hasn't complained as of yet while playing games like Skyrim on ultra with an ENB on, sure i dropped from a stable 60 FPS to a stable 30... but  ",5,GPU
"Was originally looking at a 380 for this build, but when I saw this on Jet I had to pull the trigger. Yes it's a reference and yes it runs hot as hell, but I would have kicked myself if I let it slip by for ~$450. ",4,GPU
"Runs cool (from what I can tell) and keeps up with most modern games.
Very quiet and fast!
Installation was a breeze and the software was better than  AMD catalyst ( I owned an
 HD7770 It was good but the drivers were horrid)  ",5,GPU
Great card for its price. Overclocks easily and stays very cool under the heaviest benchmarks. 67C was the highest temp recorded. Three fans vs 2 on other 960 cards were well worth it. ,5,GPU
Absolute monster got an amazing chip in mine no complaints ,5,GPU
"As somebody who has been burned by EVERY SINGLE Nvidia graphics card I have ever owned... all of them being by EVGA... I decided to take a chance with ATI (AMD) this time around... Boy, am I impressed... First, I have to congratulate MSI at converting a new follower (me) for their graphics cards. A lot of times when you have companies that make cards for both Nvidia and AMD, the company will choose a preference for one GPU over the other and either AMD or Nvidia versions will suffer based on which one they choose. This can be seen in Asus slapping their GTX 780 Matrix Platinum cooler onto their R9 290x Matrix Platinum, creating the most expensive, hottest running, poorest overclocking 290x on the market, and then selling it as an ""overclockers card"" This card is designed from the ground up for overclocking... Jesus this thing is big... First of all, it comes in a black jewelry grade box, with a satin strap that holds the lid from folding over upon opening. The ""Lightning"" logo is engraved into the bottom corner of the box in gold leaf. The bottom of the box features a drawer with a Certificate of Quality and Stability, a custom steel plate with adhesive thermal pads for if you are going to use liquid nitrogen, and some molex to 8 pin adapters. That last item should be thrown away and never included unless you want to set your house on fire. This card requires two 8-pin PCI E connectors to power it, with an optional 6-pin for extreme overclocking. With two 8-pins in, the card's Lightning logo changes color based on load: blue for idle, green for medium, and red for heavy. With the optional 6-pin in, it just stays red. There is also blue LEDs for the power phases, similar to that seen on Sapphire's R9 290 Vapor-X and 290x Vapor-X. This card is an overclocking MONSTER. It is voltage locked out of the box unless you apply for an ABK Pro Overclocker certificate from MSI... however there are ways around that.... the voltage lock only seems to be present in MSI Afterburner... if you download Trixx from Sapphire, the VDDC Offset is now unlocked (sorry, MSI, I had to, locking the voltage on this card is an abomination)... My max overclock is 1220 MHz Core (up from the 1080 MHz stock) and 1350 VRAM (up from the 1250 MHz stock). I can also get the great quality Samsung GDDR5 all the way up to 1560 MHz, or 6240 MHz effective, but to do this, I have to lower the core clock down to 1180 MHz. The 1220 MHz core results in better FPS in games, whereas the 1180 MHz core and 1560 VRAM results in a better 3dMark Firestrike score. The card never exceeds 82 C in my hot room even at max OC, though the card does get quite loud. EK has a waterblock for it, so... yeah... it's a beast. If I could give this thing 6 out of 5 stars, I would. 5/5. ",5,GPU
This is a very good looking card and it is also very quiet ,5,GPU
"Pros:
Good card for casual gaming.
Quiet Fan
Keeps cool (around 36 C when playing Guild Wars 2 which is the most demanding game I own)
Cons:
Gets dusty easily, but its easy to clean. ",5,GPU
As I got it for a 150€ I am very pleased. ,5,GPU
"The opinion about this Palit card may vary with different builders. In my case, since I don't plan to overclock it, it is awesome. It is cheap, able to maintain stable and low heat at idle. Its fans are capable of dispending heat when the card is under heavy load. Its 0-rpm technology and ball bearings inside the fans make this card remain mostly silent all the time. ",5,GPU
"Excellent GPU at the time, now aging. Does have an annoying amount of coil whine when FPS isn't capped or goes beyond 170FPS, particularly in unoptimized games and loading screens. ",4,GPU
"This monster of a card clocks well on air with no voltage change, and can be pushed quite hard when under water. The Classified PCB tends to sag quite a bit without a backplate, however. ",5,GPU
"Nice gpu, not real loud and plays all the games I'm interested in very well. ",5,GPU
"Very loud. Didn't game as well as I thought it would, but it does well enough. I cant overclock it one bit. ",3,GPU
Great performance (even better than my EVGA in my other build) but super loud noises so I sold it... ,1,GPU
"The only reason I chose this amd video card is because it seemed to me that going for a 950 or 960 gtx was not worth the big price difference, this part unlike the i5 processor that pays more than normal , I came out below 200 dollars, so I am very happy achieving ultra date or higth in many games ",5,GPU
"Solid last gen card. Got it off Craigslist for $70. Still gets very playable fps in games. ~120 in World of Tanks, 400+ in League of Legends. Will be replacing with a GTX 1080 later but has been nice to use in the meantime. ",5,GPU
"Amazing card when you don't have to deal with the vagaries of Crossfire. Still, two years on, the single slot card to beat (even though it is Dual GPU), bought it for a touch over £500 in May 2015, after finding out the 980Ti's were retailing for around £800. Can play pretty much any game at 4k and Ultra (for the most part) and if not a quick dial down to 1440p is all it needs. Have considered getting a 290x to run it in tri-fire but that would necessitate a 1200w PSU at least. ",5,GPU
Great GPU. ,5,GPU
"Such a great card, I love how quiet it runs, keeps temps real low.  Highly recommend spending the extra cash if you are looking for a 980 ti.  ",5,GPU
So this card. My first card after a 500 series. I know right I was behind. So this card is pretty STEALTH if you ask me. When on idle like now the fans do not spin until I think its at 40c but im not 100% sure. This card makes no noise period and looks sexy. I will for sure put another in for SLI. Good job ASUS!!! ,5,GPU
I got the blower style because of the ITX case but I'm still getting thermal throttling. I can get 60FPS at 2560x1600 on GTAV if I keep MSAA to x2. ,4,GPU
"Fantastic card for the price! Not for 4K gamers (obviously), but will run most demanding games (i.e. Crysis 3) at High settings @ 1080p with good frame rates while staying cool and quiet. If maximum performance is what you're looking for, go for the Toxic editions of Sapphire's cards. But for small form factor builds and other applications where cool and quiet operation are important, Vapor-X cards are simply awesome. Very amenable to overclocking. I had no problems running the card with a GPU clock of 1200MHz and memory clock of 1500MHz, which surprised me. Maybe I won the silicon lottery? Who knows. Many other OCers have reported similar successes with this card. Card still ran cool - around 64C max at these clocks. I'm just a casual gamer though so I'm happy running the card at stock clocks. ",5,GPU
"The price, after an EVGA rebate, was more than right for an HD-capable card that will mostly be used in 2D situations. ",4,GPU
"Good GPU for the cost. Not very loud, but quite powerful. However I wish I had spent a bit more to get the R9 280X instead.  ",4,GPU
Fantastic for my uses ,5,GPU
"Fantastic card, Looks badass and perform the same. ",5,GPU
"I got this for cheap, runs everything max settings at 900P! (Probably can do it at 1080P as well) ",5,GPU
"I can't say enough good things about this EVGA 980. In fact, I don't think I'm going to buy anything but EVGA in the future. The build quality is amazing in this thing. When you pick it up and feel the weight and materials used, you know it's a quality product. It's slicing through everything that I've thrown at it so far. ",5,GPU
"Great gateway into PC, but bulky and got outclassed quickly.  ",3,GPU
"VERY GOOD, i paid just under $700 AUD for this graphics card, so even though a normal priced 980 would be considered 'over priced' this one is very good. Destroys any game at 1080p (i play at 1920x1200 because i need a new monitor) 
I'm kinda sad that there isn't a backplate standard. ",5,GPU
Great starter card. Already overclock so you cant get much more out of it (or at least I couldn't - took from 1070 to 1150 any high and it dies. Sapphire Trixx helps a lot) Plays everything I have tried at high but as games get more demanding I will upgrade or crossfire in future. ,4,GPU
still performs and does what I need! ,4,GPU
I haven't been able to get this card up to its full potential.  I am waiting for my FX 8 Core to come in.  This card by Gigabyte comes with there patented Windforce 3 cooler.  It does a great job at keeping the card cool.  It can handle anything I throw at it.  It is great for 1080p gaming.  This card is as far as I want to take this build since even the FX 8 core would be a bottle neck for the 980. ,5,GPU
Sketchy on ultra settings need to upgrade soon. ,4,GPU
"Very good GPU, and QUIET too.  Had to RMA the first card, and almost RMA'd the second before finding the issue.  These cards are overclocked on the memory too much. 1500 is stock, and I am currently running this card at 1490. Using AMD Catalyst Control Center to adjust is perfect. This card will run anything on max settings, CPU dependent. ",3,GPU
Epic card! It blasts through games and the included backplate is great. The card is pretty silent most of the time and stays cool! I can max most games at 1080p and get great fps. Definitely recommend this card! ,5,GPU
Despite what others thinks it runs so well. Max settings at 1080. ,5,GPU
"When i first got this gpu 3-4 years ago, I was able to max just about every game I played. Now it can't max most games anymore. Time for a replacement this summer. ",5,GPU
Nice looking card! great price! Wish I could get a backplate for it though. ,5,GPU
"Being able to run 60+ FPS with just one card, I've been able to get 100+ FPS in War Thunder and other games that support Crossfire. Still, newer cards are better, but in 2012-2013, this worked just fine, and it's still doing good in 2015. ",5,GPU
"For $70 from EVGA's B-Stock (unfortunately it is no longer available from there), it is a great card that rivals my (now $150) GTX 950 in performance. If you are able to find this card for around that price, I highly suggest it for a budget build. ",5,GPU
Very quiet at idle but can be noisy at load. Regardless it is powerful enough to play modern games at very high or ultra at 1080p which is all I wanted. ,5,GPU
"Awesome card! The reference cooler design is very underrated. It is plenty cooling to keep the card performing well, while at the same time keeping hot air from just circulating in the case.  ",5,GPU
"Best price:performance ratio I have seen. Excellent build quality, large factory overclock that significantly impacts performance. Plays modern games on high to max settings at 1080p with 60fps. Combination of triple fans and vapor chamber cooling keeps it below 60°C at all times, looks absolutely beautiful. Very large, 12.13""/308mm length so make sure your case can fit it. Can make cable management somewhat difficult especially in a mid tower with a non-modular PSU. Got it on sale on Newegg for 220 USD, best deal on a graphics card I have ever seen. ",5,GPU
"great gpu fast and decently quiet,plays most games at max above 30 fps ",4,GPU
"Although these in SLI still provide very good performance in games on maximum settings, they have lots of problems with the stock clock rate and voltage settings on the Gigabyte version of these cards. Can be very unstable with lots of crashes unless you lower the clock rate or up the voltage. ",4,GPU
"Budget. Budget Budget. Paid $120 in Feb 2015. I wouldn't pay anymore. If you are not hard core, but you want to live hard core, and as long as your rent is not legendarily high, this one is for you. OC features are nice and GPU Tweak is pretty straight forward. It still gets 4 stars from me because of that and its price.  ",4,GPU
"If the card 2gb it would be so much better. Its about 2/3 the speed of a r9 280x, but has 1gb of vram. It could be better, but it runs pretty well for the age of the card. 3/5 stars ",3,GPU
This card is light years above what I have been running for the last 7 yrs I have been playing WoW. ,5,GPU
"It's hot, and it's hot. I keep the fan manually set to 80% just about all the time, but it can handle just about everything I throw at it. I don't find the fan terribly loud, but I have headphones on most of the time and have quite a bit of ambient sound in the apartment. ",5,GPU
The coup de grâce of graphics cards. Love it. ,5,GPU
"Great card, wish I had waited to get the 380x though. ",5,GPU
Wish i would've saved up and bought a R9 290x but i was too impatient  ,3,GPU
Driving an LG EW 224T.  More than capable. ,5,GPU
Great card if you can get it for under $100.  ,4,GPU
Brilliant card. I have had nothing it cannot run well yet. It remains quiet under loads and the fans cannot be heard when I have my headset on. The GPU tweak from Asus makes over clocking quick and easy whilst also allowing the monitoring of temps and controlling the fans.  ,5,GPU
"No noise, no coil whine and simply amazing. They actually test it before they send it to you so was garunteed no noise and coil whine. ",5,GPU
What can I say besides WOW!  I got a great deal on this graphics card.   This was the cheapest  GTX 1070 at the time of purchase.  I feel like I received a much more expensive graphics card as I had no problem overclocking this card and get it to boost to the golden 2.1 GHz.  So far I have added 145 MHz to the core clock speed and 500 MHz to the memory making the core specs: core clock = 1727 MHz and memory effective = 9000 MHz.  I have not noticed any coil while and the card does manage to stay cool in my Node 202 build. ,5,GPU
Runs pretty hot at times and I'm forced to ramp up the fan speed. It's also quite loud during load. It works though and it's a monster in gaming. ,4,GPU
"Best Graphics ever, It is better than my motherboard GPU (no Duh) ",5,GPU
"The Devil is a beast, for sure.  It's ugly, too, but most of the ugly can't be seen as it sits on the underbelly.  It runs fast!  It runs cool!  It runs every single game I can throw at it!!!  My only gripes are the fans and the shroud.  The fans are not silent by any definition, and the shroud is bulky and part of it protrudes higher than the total thickness of the card because the fan on the card sits at a 15 degree angle, giving a pointy corner that sticks up higher than it should.  This is keeping me from putting a second Devil card in this case because that pointy part of the shroud hits my power supply.  Maybe there's a way to grind it down or take it off and rig up something better. ",5,GPU
"Small and powerful. I was initially worried whether  3GB of VRAM would be enough but decided to go with it regardless. For 1080p/60fps gaming, this little beast is hitting everything I throw at it with ease. ",5,GPU
Great GPU ,4,GPU
"Very good graphics card. I have over-clocked them many times already and found the max on these cards are the following for anyone looking for good clocks on these cards: Boost GPU by max 168MHz. 169 might work but don't pass 170. Increase the over-voltage by about 12 and max memory boost was about 690MHz. So It's a great card to work with and is what got my most recent 3Dmark score to 10000+ with 2-way SLI.
Turns out that this card in 2-way SLI beats a single GTX titan. I'm very impressed! ",5,GPU
Very impressed.  Plays just about anything. ,5,GPU

Great first-build casual gaming card! (but recommended for the enthusiasts!) Also consider the ram sizes/speeds (I didn't notice). ,4,GPU
"For the price you really can't find a better deal. Able to play most games on 1080p resolution at medium to high settings. Some lag and stuttering at times, probably related to the 2gb ram. Easily over clocked it to 1050mhz. Gets very loud at times. ",4,GPU
"Great card for 1080p, actually a little overkill to be honest. I did not want any games to be bottlenecked, so this offered enough to last many years. The 3.5 bug doesn't effect me and I got a partial refund, so no regrets here. Runs cool and quiet. Only complaint is that it doesn't have a backplate for the price. ",5,GPU
"Runs cool and quiet with 95mm fans, does not need high RPM to keep it at 60-65C. Wider PCB makes it a large card and might not fit some cases. Fans not ball bearing unlike MSI 1070/80 variants. MSI GAMING APP utility needs to run in the background to control LED settings, no temperature / fan speed modes for LED. ",5,GPU
"No OC is planned, and I didn't mess with WattMan, so at stock it performs as expected, can't wait for more dx12 games to rock. Temps up to 85C, with fans up to 53%. Surprisingly quiet for a reference, IMHO very good fan profile, with more aggressive profile it  could get cooler but loud, not worth it.  ",5,GPU

"This was by far the most difficult decision and one that I still don't know if I did the right thing but what's done is done. I honestly dont have the patience for the EVGA 980Ti to be back in stock and really aside from price there's no way to go wrong with the TX, that 12GB of VRAM should carry me through many years (let's hope) and if at some point I feel I need to upgrade I'll just get another and run in SLI. I got the backplate for it cause I know this sucker runs hot so ~3 less heat is something I'll take. Now I'm just waiting for the Hybrid cooler kit to become available from EVGA. Update: got the hybrid cooler, got tired of waiting for the TX version and settled on the 980 one which is awesome, same parts just different colored shroud. It has done wonders for my temps and is a must buy for anyone not doing a custom loop. ",5,GPU
"I got it for cheap, amazing for what I payed. It's rather old, so you shouldn't seek this card out. But if you get a chance to get it for under $30, don't pass it up. ",5,GPU
"This GPU is a beast but sadly i have no clue how to overclock it. I tried but when it locked at a core clock of only 500 i reset it back to factory and will not dive back in there. Maybe years down the road but not anytime soon. Also this runs pretty hot, the backplate will usually give you an idea how hard its running at any given time ",3,GPU
"Great graphics card for the price. Stays at around 60 to 75 C when running games, even when gpu clock is raised, and  30 C when idle. Goes up to 85 when playing games at 4k, but its 4k and the game is running at its highest settings, so yeah. ",5,GPU

"I future-proofed my build with this card. I spent more money to have one of the best cards out there, instead of doing an SLI. I have never done SLI, but from the research I have done, it is better to go with one card instead of two. Power consumption is low, and I didn't have to buy multiple GPU blocks. Future-proofing the card assures that my watercooling set-up won't need to change for a long time. I can always get another one of these down the road and SLI it, but for now it runs anything I throw at it without breaking a sweat. ",5,GPU
"Runs quiet and performs without a fuss. No additional power connector needed, which is great for a clean looking build or for retrofitting into an older computer. I edit video (not professionally) with Resolve and it seems to be doing a good job since Resolve utilizes GPU power. I wish they would offer a version with 2 x HDMI connectors though. ",5,GPU
"I love this old, Asus ENGTX 460 1 GB graphics, card it was one of the first of its kind with Direct CU.  It has been a true work horse for me for years and I found another one exactly the same to use them in SLI. ",5,GPU
The elusive butterfly. I love the card. It's beautiful and handles everything I throw at it perfectly. No overclocking yet as I haven't seen the need to. White LEDs go with everything. Just wish it was in stock more frequently at the time so I could have built sooner. And preferably for a lower price. ,5,GPU
Solid upgrade from a 960 ,5,GPU
"pretty much the component holding back this pc's ""old potential"". will be replaced by a GTX 960 once prices drop....  ",3,GPU
Definitely a card worth mentioning for someone who doesn't want to spend thousands on a build and wants graphics to match the latest consoles. ,5,GPU
"Asus ROG GeForce GTX 1080 8GB STRIX. My prized possession graphics card. Camped newegg and spent a fortune for it, but it is a beast! Go Nvidia!  ",5,GPU
A great card. Quiet and enough power to run most games at 60 FPS. A little worried about the GPU temp as it idles at 120 F. But I'm told that's normal. ,4,GPU
"It worked and fit my color scheme. Doesn't come with a back plate, but I'm not sure if any 1060s come with them. Probably overkill, but her PC should be able to handle some video editing (not super intensive). ",4,GPU
"Great, great card. I was skeptical about getting a Zotac GPU because they are generally cheaper and I had never heard of them. I was wrong! The cooler always keeps the chip icy cool. And the 750 Ti itself is still a great card, for both power consumption and price/performance. ",5,GPU
Ooooold card - but still holds up surprisingly well. ,3,GPU
"AMD did a great job with its new Polaris architecture. This card is described as having a TDP of 225 watts howevers it never comes close to using that. I checked full system power draw while playing intensive games at 1440p and the computer never drew more than 220 watts. This is a premium, well-built, and silent card that performs well at a good price point. I recommend it.  ",5,GPU
Still hanging today AAA games. Coil Whines a bit when case is open. ,4,GPU
"This card is a monster. Both at playing games, and also as far as how big it is. Easily the largest card I've ever seen. This is the Tri-X, factory OC'd version of the Sapphire Radeon R9 390X GPU. I'm extremely pleased with the performance overall, but if you're considering this for your own build then you need to check and make sure that your case will allow you to fit a card that's 14"" in length. It has three fans for cooling mounted in the shroud which adds length to the card overall. Most other companies run with two fans on this GPU. I'm glad I went with the Sapphire though, performance is great, it keeps itself cool, and I got it on sale through Amazon Prime for less than what the competitors are asking for their own cards which aren't factory overclocked.  In my situation I had to dremel a section of my HDD bay (no biggie, cheap case) to make this card fit. So keep that in mind.  ",5,GPU
Worked Great was Better than Expected  ,5,GPU
"I can't begin to describe how much I love this GPU. I think it's an amazing card for if your on a budget or you just don't want to spend more than you need to. Been throwing lots of games at it over these last few months of having it, and with basically every game I've played, except maybe shadow of morder, I've been able to play on high with no issue. For a little more reference, GTA5 can run on high at 60-70 FPS, and Black Ops 2 can run max at around 120 FPS. ",5,GPU
"Unbelievable! Plays almost everything at 1080p 60hz and 40+ fps at high/ultra. Unless you are a pro gamer, this is everything you'll need an then some.  ",5,GPU
"Great small form-factor GTX 960. Lots of room for overclocking and runs nice and cool, extremely quiet as well. However, would only recommend if space is an issue or if you're gaming at strictly 1080p. Card struggles at higher settings above 1080p. Also, at this point in time, it's the only future proof HTPC card; it's the only GPU on the market that supports full (non-hybrid) HEVC decode, and it has HDCP 2.2 and HDMI 2.0. Bought this model because it was on sale, but if given the choice, would've liked a factory overclocked edition. If space is no constraint, get the larger profile version of this card for more overclocking headroom. ",5,GPU
"Where do I start? This card was just awesome. Freeze feature is great when the GPU is at idle; fans stop spinning completely. RGB lighting is great for any themed build. I have not overclocked this card yet, but I expect it to be great! ",5,GPU
Casual gaming vid card. Used with 60hz monitor ,3,GPU
"I honestly have disliked this card for a while now. Loud when the fan is above 40%, and produces a ton of heat, the two things I hate the most in computer parts. However, it's lasted this long, and it continues to run games incredibly easily. I would recommend this card to people who are stuck in the past and want a cheap card that will last you upwards of 4 years. ",4,GPU
Good quality. Fan 2 failed prematurely but Sapphire took care of it within a week. Maxes out everything at 1080p 60+ frames. ,4,GPU
Coming from my old GTX 480 SLI setup? Doing dual GTX 680's in SLI are AMAZING! A single GTX 680 performs at stock speeds almost as fast as dual 480s... that's an impressive performance leap with the Kepler Architecture. Kudos to nVidia for making such monstrous cards. Got these cheap off a bud for the pair after he started selling a bunch of AMD R9 cards and kept two himself heh. ,5,GPU
"This thing is crunching any game I throw at it at max settings with no effort. I'm not surprised and I'd be dissapointed if it wasn't, but still...coming from a ****** laptop GPU I'm in heaven. Install was painless, and the RGB effects are pretty sick.  ",5,GPU
Pricy but performant.  Mine is holding steady at a core clock of 2025MHz.  The crazy three-fan air cooler on this thing is gigantic (this is a 3 slot card) but keeps the chips cool without much noise.  Under full load I'm nowhere near hitting power or thermal limits and the cooler is keeping the card at 66ºC with fan noise barely above a whisper. ,5,GPU
The fact that it can run my games at high settings above 60 fps surprises me so much. Keep in mind that I was gaming on a regular laptop before this build. ,4,GPU
"Couldn't decide between an Rx 480 or gtx 1060. Both are incredibly low on stock, apparently until September, I ain't waiting that long  so I just decided to buy the first one of whichever I could find that was in stock at not a totally overinflated price. It absolutely smashes 1080p gaming, the 6gb vram is overkill though I don't get anywhere near it ",5,GPU
"Good looking, extremely quiet, thermals are amazing, and solid performance. ",5,GPU
"Love the card. It took a lot of heat for being more expensive than a 480 with 4gb RAM, but it has some features that make up for that. It's more efficient, so if you use the card for a few years, the price difference swings in the other direction. It runs cool and quietly (hasn't gotten over 60c even when gaming). It's one of the best looking graphics cards I've ever seen, and if I'm going to be looking at it for the next few years, it's worth paying a few extra dollars for the aesthetic boost. Yes, you could pay a bit more and get an aftermarket 480 with better performance, or you could pay a little bit less for a little less performance. ",5,GPU
"Great card, I think its the cheapest GTX 1070 you can get so far! ",5,GPU
i want the asus strix 1060 which is a better one than this but sadly my budget wont be enough to cover the expense. anyway this is still fine.  ,4,GPU
"This was also sourced from my main PC, sitting around unused after being replaced by an R9 390. it's starting to show its age a bit, but still does pretty well in games. ",4,GPU
"Though it's way overpriced in my opinion, the Maxwell Titan X is still an amazing card. Crushes every game we've seen maxed out @ 1080p. ",5,GPU
"Great graphics card. Perfect for 1080 HD Gaming and future proof with it's directX 12 features. 4GB VRAM is enough for 1080p gaming, the 8GB version would have just been overkill. Only negative I can think of is the fan  noise level when it's at full throttle. ",4,GPU
"Good graphics card, but it gets very hot. ",3,GPU
Love it so far. Haven't overclocked but i'm not too worried. Runs very quiet and temps have been great. ,5,GPU
Marvelous.. ,5,GPU
I originally was going to go for a GTX 970 but if course i heard about the 3.5ghz thing etc etc.. and decided on going with AMD. Originally was going to go for a 390 or 390x But saw this and kinda fell in love with it. Fans look awesome. Only thing i'm kinda weird about is the upside down logo. I dunno if its a mistake or not but i don't care. Its great looking and acts like a beast.  yes i could of gone with a 1060 but when you fall in love with something you just gotta go with your heart. ,5,GPU
This GPU is excellent. It has amazing price to performance ratio and plays all newer games with many if not all setting on high or ultra. The only gripe that I have with this GPU is the amount of power it draws under heavy load and how hot it gets. Other than that I could not have found a better card for the price! ,4,GPU
"Cant get any better than this because it beats 950,960, and its comparable to the 970. ",5,GPU
"I love this new series of Radeon. They allow you to customize the color of the MSI logo on the card using their program. Absolutely silent, and stayed at 59 degress under the furmark stress test for 5 minutes. Amazing.  ",5,GPU
I can still play all my games on full graphics with this card and CPU. It doesn't get too loud either when in an intensive graphics game. ,4,GPU
Bang for buck card. Not exactly the coolest card in the world but still destroying the games Im throwing at it. Just wish it could be cooler. ,4,GPU
"The reason behind this build. The GTX 970 was a great card for 1080p gaming. This card seems to be it's eqivalent for 1440p gaming. Ran everything I benchmarked very very well and I think he's going to like it a lot. Yeah the FE is paying a premium to get the card quicker but hey, he wanted his computer and I was able to find it on launch day. The blower style cooler works well in his case as well. ",5,GPU
Don't buy this unless you can get it at a significant discount. Don't even consider it if your CPU was made in the last 5 years and has integrated graphics. This card is clearly starved for bandwidth because a small memory overclock will grant a significant performance boost... relatively speaking of course. ,4,GPU
"this card is pretty amazing. it doesn't feel like a high-end card, but usually the ""armor"" series isn't. but it's a 1060, which gives you 980 or better performance for half the price. the white and black theme is great too. matches the whole MSI W/B theme. ",5,GPU
It was a donated item as well from my buddy. He was upgrading to Skylake iTX and it cant fit the GPU. So i got it for free to upgrade from my Geforce 8600GT :) Run Firestrike 3DMark ,4,GPU
"Don't let the reference cooler scare you, it is great. The Reference cooler doesn't just look great, it performs greatly too. The GPU is staying cool and not throttling, I would recommend this 390x over any other one for Xfire and it also again, looks really nice. ",5,GPU
out of box on boost clock I got just over 1400MHz but I used the EVGA PrecisionX 16 to OC it and got 1511MHz stable and temps around 60~65c with the fans up to 75% on hard lode games with 1 GPU. with 2 I'm at default settings with 65~77c under lode. (update) with OC settings I got 1480MHz at stable gaming and the temps did not get over 83c   ,5,GPU
"I picked this card up for $88 on a sale. I originally bought it for another machine, but the lackluster performance I was seeing on the Intel HD4600 as well as the ongoing driver issues with two different mobo led me to check the size and install to this build. It was tight and required me to re-route some of the cabling. The cards cooling is well designed and adding it  didn't raise case temps at all. Performance is amazing being used on the living room media center.  ",5,GPU
"Nice, but not too-nice  $$. ",4,GPU
"If I could do a 4 and a half stars, I would. The only bad thing I have to say about this card is the fan is louder than I expected, and always runs. Other than that it's very nice, with good performance and cooling. ",4,GPU
"At the time of writing there are no prices for this in UK (18/08/16) but you can get it at overclockers which is where i got it a couple of weeks ago.  It is an absolute beast of a card which takes up just over two slots on the motherboard due to its unique 'stack' fan system of three overlapping 100mm fans. These appear to be pretty effective as the graphics card rarely exceeds 61c while gaming on auto mode. You can set it up with your own fan graph or choose Turbo, Auto, or Silent mode.  There is also the easy capability to use the software with the card to overclock and boost performance even further. This is an ideal card for those wishing to game on ultra high settings at 1440p at a frame rate of 60+ on even the most demanding games. ",5,GPU
This card is probably the best looking 10 series out there in my opinion other than the Founder's Editions. I went with a blower style because I have 3 fans in the front blowing a lot of air to the rear. The GPU can just suck it in and cool itself. ,5,GPU
Four years with one video card feels like forever but it really continued to get high fps in games until this year in which it slowly started to struggle. Would definitely buy another EVGA product/video card in the future for my next build. ,5,GPU
"Love the STRIX series, wish I had held out for the 980Ti models (I have two in my rig), fan doesn't spin unless you need it to and when it does, you'll never hear it. ",5,GPU
"great,quiet,cool only thing to make it better is if it had a back plate  ",5,GPU
Runs everything I throw at it at 60FPS. Runs hot compared to its competitors but good nonetheless. ,5,GPU
best gpu out there and will destroy 4k in the future ,5,GPU
"I hear that the temps I am getting for this under load (81c) are normal for founders editions but I still worry a bit.  Graphics are top notch, I can play pretty much everything I throw at it between 60-120fps on High Quality. ",4,GPU
"I knew that I 100% wanted to get a powerful GPU and I found the perfect one. A Radeon RX 480 chipset with 8 GIGS (yes, 8!) of VRAM. The thing also has an LED control that you can set to make if static, color changing, or blinking. The perfect card! ",5,GPU
"Very pleased. I thought this would be overkill for my non-gaming use and it may well be, but compared to built-in graphics the performance of just about everything on the screen is infinitely better than I've been used to for a long time. Since my work doesn't involve games, I am not terribly concerned about frame rates. Furmark says this one is managing 23fps on my 4K screen and 40fps at 1080p. Seems to drop of rather dramatically after 1080p though, with QHD performance hardly better than 4K. In my normal use the fans rarely come on. When they come on during a test or other stressful use they are quite quiet.  I haven't bothered overclocking it, so can't comment on how it handles that. ",5,GPU
Great cards. hold up well enough on 2560*1440/1600 gaming when SLi is properly supported. ,5,GPU
"For how old this thing is I must say it does well, I have the 512 mb version and I can run just about anything on 1080p 60+ frames on low settings It does get loud really quick, pretty much quiet idle or hair dryer load, pretty much no in between  ",4,GPU
,5,GPU
"If you have the budget for one, this card is king. I game at QHD and no game I own can slow this card down at max settings (Save for some of the crazy AA settings in certain recent AAA games). It runs circles around my old 960 SLI setup! ",5,GPU
This performs great!  I can play BO2 at 60 fps at ultra at 900p!  It also has a great cooler that makes overclocking a breeze. ,5,GPU
"This is the hardest part in choosing part for my build. I want to play at 1080p resolution 60 fps. Many videos in youtube using GTX 970 and i tempted to get it as well since it was so popular. However, the price hasn't went down due to its popularity. In other hand, at first, i want to build a HTPC or mini ITX pc. Thus, i decide to get this one so i can still use it for my next build ",5,GPU
"Amazing for the price, loved it. ",5,GPU
Love this card.  Skyrim on Ultra settings...smooth as butter. ,5,GPU
"SUCH AN AMAZING CARD! This thing runs cool, quiet, and fast! Easy to work with, and super cheap! Going to crossfire when more come out! ",5,GPU
"The 390 in my opinion is the new king of price to performance. you cant argue with numbers... I will say however the card runs hot, is power hungry and drivers are crap... But this is not a problem for me. ",5,GPU
"this GPU is the reason behind my color scheme I love how sexy it looks and the quality of the materials is top notch and premium  feel however If you want more performance and better cooling  please buy the aftermarket version of the GTX 1080 like the EVGA FTW or Classy, Asus ROG strix or a Zotac amp gigabyte and msi have some good custom 1080 too so check them out. ",5,GPU
"Overclocked, comfortable dimensions for my mini-ITX case (FD Core 500) and big, quiet fans. ",5,GPU
"As powerful as a Titan X for $330 less. Totally worth the price. A little bit, but that extra size allows for some really killer stability and performance improvements. ",5,GPU
"Not easy to fit into this case, although that was obvious since it's listed as 10mm longer than the case allows. Despite this, I found a way to make it fit after about 30 minutes without breaking anything or altering the case. I did take the upper drive cage out, that seemed to help. Got this on sale at  ",5,GPU
"Not much to say, it aged well in that it can still play some new games at low settings. Stays quiet, but lets out a lot of heat. ",4,GPU
"Oh man am I exceedingly pleased with this purchase. Picked up at GpuShack with a $30 discount, this card so far has been a dream. After logging around 250 hours of Skyrim and Fallout 3 on my cheap little laptop running 12-20fps experiencing this thing is surreal. Been running Shadow of Mordor on ultra settings and averaging 60-70fps. Skyrim with maxed out settings and around 30 mods including several HD texture packs performs equally well. Never seen this card drop below 50fps on anything I've thrown at it so far. Came with a DVI/VGA adapter, crossfire bridge, and 3 year warranty. GpuShack is awesome. ",5,GPU
"The Club 3D R9 280! This card is sweet, any game I've thrown at it has run flawlessly aside from Arma 3, it's the only game I got an average of 35-30 FPS on max settings. ",5,GPU
"An Asus Strix RX480 8Gb (which in my opinion is the best-looking GPU in the market) that thanks to the new Crimson Relive drivers, closes the performance gaps within NVidia, moreover, DX12 and Vulkan are coming and it will make these AMD GPUs great performers for the price. Considering this, I think that they'll have a longer lifespan than NVidia counterparts. (But that's all my thinking). The 3 fans installed keep the GPU always under the 70 degrees (and are also very silent, I must look at them to notice if they're spinning) even with a light overclock (1400Mhz on the core and 2100Mhz to the memory) and after long gaming sessions and thanks to the steel back plate and RGB light this card gives a great touch to your rig. This GPU takes 2 slots of space and fit perfectly in the case. ",4,GPU
Very impressed with the amount of power they put in this card for the price and size. ,5,GPU
It's extremely loud but I only paid $150 back then and it is faster than the Intel integrated. ,3,GPU
Using MSI Afterburner on this thing was and absolute ease of controlablilty with this. I'm going to get a vinyl sticker cut to cover the white. MLG rating: 8/8 m8 ,5,GPU
Picked it up for CHEAP and it runs my older titles just fine. haven't benchmarked anything because frankly I don't care. Runs New Vegas at High 1080 with 2x AA and 4x AS ,4,GPU
