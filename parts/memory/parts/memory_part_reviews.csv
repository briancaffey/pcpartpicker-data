"Basic RAM, works as it should. The basic timings of this memory are 9-9-9-24, and I've run it at 8-8-8-24 since the very beggining with no issues. ",3,memory
"I like these because they aren't ridiculously huge. The PCB isn't coloured black as I hoped it would be, but that's minor. Having 8gb is great for virtual machines and multitasking. The timings are listed as 9-9-9-24 in an XMP profile but  XMP is only supported by Intel. If you have an AMD mobo it will probably load the timings from the JEDEC profile, which are much looser (11-11-11-28, I think). Since it won't load the settings automatically you just have to set them yourself. ",5,memory
RAM is RAM. End of story. ,5,memory
No problems what so ever.  ,5,memory
Its yellow-ish! ,5,memory
Does as advertised. ,5,memory
Good RAM. I made a mismatch on this one. I was originally going for the black Kingston HyperX RAM but there was no stock on the date of purchase. ,4,memory
"Quality RAM, great performer, looks amazing. ",5,memory
8GB of RAM makes this old rig seem refreshed. A wise $30 investment. ,5,memory
"Not going to lie. I bought it because it was the right color blue I wanted. 2666 is a great speed to get that doesn't require more voltage, which is nice and it came in a good price. No complaints here. ",5,memory
"Great timing and good size.  Color is more black than silver, fwiw.  Not an issue for me. ",5,memory
It's ram. it performs as advertised. Enough said. I have not attempted to clock above spec as there is very little point for my purposes.  ,5,memory
Advertised speeds and they look great. Wished there was a way to control the LEDs. ,5,memory
"Looks good, don't really care for performance. ",5,memory
If you plan on running BF4 at 1080p 120+fps YOU NEED 2400mhz ram. I didn't realize how important it was for BF4 until endless hours of messing my machine parts.  Aside from that this thing runs fantastically. I was running at 1866mhz stock by mistake. Sorry I was noob at the time on how to change the MHz of my ram. Once I unlocked its full potential by manually setting it to 2400mhz this thing made all the difference.  No issues. Hope this helps. Feel free to ask me any questions ,5,memory
"Typical, dependable, and reliable RAM from Corsair. Not loud and flashy, and no massive heatsinks so they fit under the cooler. ",5,memory
"Works really well,no problems whatsoever. ",5,memory
"What can I say, its RAM. Good price, good speed, god bless less play.  ",4,memory
"Great RAM, not much to say about it.  ",5,memory
"I managed to get it cheap, otherwise nothing much I can say ",4,memory
"Very good price and I liked its lights, I wanted something subtle, no strips of led loose, something about the hardware, buy your partner when you want more ram, and for the characteristics (ddr4 to 2400), it is worth over other brands . Note: in theory you can not control led lights, they just blink and that's it ",5,memory
"While I currently have only one module of RAM installed, a second one is on its way.  No complaints so for, and games load pretty quickly. ",5,memory
Great kit. Zero issues @ rated speeds ,5,memory
"It's RAM and it's fast. And it looks great, not much of a premium for it either. Sadly the LED effects are not controlled by any software at the moment but nevertheless it looks fantastic. ",5,memory
"A little bit disappointed with this item, as I was not able to overclock it to DDR4-3000 as I expected. But it is a CAS 15 and the price is right. ",4,memory
"Patriot Viper 4, 16G, DDR4-3000.  Working stable on 3000 MHz (overclocked) , XMP is recognized right in BIOS, what more is there to ask? It was a cheapest set I found on Amazon (that's where I purchased most of the parts excluding case and led controller) and I do not regret it. ",5,memory
"Memory - got single channel ram becuase it was on a good deal, running at 1866mhz, i guess it is a good ram, does its job. no problems yet. ",5,memory
Not fancy but functional--what more do you need for a non-OC'd build? ,5,memory
Great ram for a great price. Gives me room to buy another one in the future for more ram if operating systems become more demanding. ,5,memory
Does its job but since it can't run at its proper speed due to motherboard incompatibles so I can't speak to how it performs at normal speeds but at 1600 it works great! ,5,memory
Works perfectly. ,5,memory
"I bought this set because they were going for a good price on an ebay auction. £37 for 16GB, I'll take it. 8GB would be enough for most, but with Chrome seemingly taking another 250MB with every update, and the video and photo editing I enjoy doing, I feel that I will make use of the full 16GB. Yes the heatspreaders are a garish blue and unnecessarily large, but value is value, it's just RAM. It won't give you 1866Mhz speed at 10CAS until you deliberately set the XMP profile in the BIOS, so be careful. ",5,memory
"Clocked high at a decent voltage, does what it needs to do and does it quite well. ",4,memory
1866 to me is the sweet spot for ram. I love the look of these and it overall fits really well with the build red scheme. ,5,memory
RAM seems fine - bit hard to tell if it is hindering the rest of the build or not.  A little concerned that I am running it at 1.6V and not 1.5V which Intel 4790K recommends.  Keen to hear what others run this RAM at? ,5,memory
"RAM is RAM, nuff said ",5,memory
"Fast RAM from a good company for a good price and low profile to boot! Great kit of RAM, brilliant color as well. Can't go wrong with this set. ",5,memory
"I have not experienced any problems with this ram whatsoever, it gives awesome performance and overclocks to 2133mhz. ",5,memory
Can't complain. Was on sale at the time and matched my motherboard. ,5,memory
Nice RAM. ,5,memory
"Fast RAM, low latency.  Nothing to report other than no issues. ",5,memory
Its G.Skill. They don't disappoint.  Love the heatsinks on these.  ,5,memory
Wanted to pick memory that was on the supported list for the mother board. Its DDR4-3000 and I was able to enable the XMP option in the BIOS without issue.  Not too much red so that was good also. ,5,memory
Since ive always been running many apps at once and gaming at the same time 16gb would be efficient. The brand really didnt matter just the price. Timings not as fast as other brands but doubt i would notice. ,3,memory
"They're fast, match my color scheme, and were purchased for a great price so nothing but good things to say about this ram and would definitely recommend them to anyone. ",5,memory
Ecc ram does Ecc ram stuff. I like lot's of ram. ,5,memory
"Good, low-profile RAM with low CAS latency. The ones I got has 14 but couldn't find them in the list. ",5,memory
Lightning fast memory. Have had no issues with it. ,5,memory

It's memory. It works. ,5,memory
Does what it's used for.  ,5,memory
"Good to look, good to overclock, no problem working at the displayed speed.  ",5,memory
"Took a chance with this RAM considering price at the time of purchase and the relatively unrecognized name of the company at the time. I am completely pleased. I have used this set of ram in 3 different builds and it was picked up by the XMP profile each time with no issues, ran perfectly fine in stability testing, and all of them have been in use for about a year with no deaths. ",5,memory
"Simple value ram, does what is needed. ",5,memory
"Cheap, fast DDR3. With 4 lanes on my motherboard, 2x8GB is perfect for upgrading with in the future. ",5,memory
(updated part) yes i know the ram is higher speed them my board can handle but i got them for 50 bucks brand new cant complain and i like how they look overall satisfied ,5,memory
"Didn't really have any issues with them, except my motherboard does not support 3333MHz RAM, so I had to enable XMP and then manually set the multiplier to 3200MHz. Other than that, they've been pretty solid. ",5,memory
Damn cool  ,5,memory
Great but to note this SKU includes fan coolers. Anybody want some Vengeance coolers? JK ,5,memory
Very fast RAM for being nearly five years old now. ,5,memory
"RAM is RAM, not much to say. Originally just had the one stick, added the other as I was upgrading. ",5,memory
"No issues, Memory is Memory  ",4,memory
"After flipping the switch my build wouldn't boot.  After a few minutes of grief and a little research I pulled one of the sticks out and thank God it booted up.  One bad stick.  I traded the sticks in the motherboard slots to test if it was the motherboard but it was the one stick.   Newegg was great in taking it back, and while the 2nd pair booted up just fine, the latency detected by the motherboard was a little higher than advertised.  I haven't messed with voltage or anything as it's fine, but still a bit of a headache.   The red color matches perfectly with the rest of the build. ",3,memory
"Its ram... Um, it works, I guess it overclocks nicely, and it has a good looking heat sink. Um, yeah.  ",5,memory
"Not much to say here.  I wanted DDR4 with a native 2400Mhz speed for interoperability with OSX.  Other than that, color and value were the most important aspects.  I don't particularly care to see the yellow-ish edges of the PCBs on this RAM, but the white heatsinks definitely look good, and at $125 for 32GB from a trusted OE supplier who manufactures their own chips, you can't really go wrong. ",4,memory
Works as it should and looks good ,5,memory
"This is one of those products where you can't say much about it at all. One of those purchases you feel completely neutral about.
There are no pros, no cons, the only thing I can say is that its RAM. ",4,memory
Bought a second pair to total 16GB. Overclocked to 1800. No issues ,5,memory
"Good ram for $75, I haven't used faster ram but I can't imagine it's a noticeable speed difference. Love the sleek black design, everyone knows good looking parts make your computer run faster. ",5,memory
"Does the job. May be a little slow, huh? ",4,memory
"Overkill? Yes.
Looks good in the build. I opted for 2666 over any higher because I frankly do not see the need. ",5,memory
"It is RAM, the CAS 9 makes up for the low clock speed. ",4,memory
"8 gb of ram for a good price, just not so crash hot without heatspreaders. ",3,memory
"Very nice looking heat spreader although PC part picker doesn't have an image. It's pretty fast, and works well, not much else to say. ",4,memory
I had this lying around (it's a place holder until i can get a hold of different RAM)Looks terrible but doesn't affect performance ,3,memory
"Memory is ram!
It's all rather pretty. ",5,memory
"For Rams, I just went with whatever was on sale. Everyone told me that 16gb is the new norm and these Team Dark Rams were on sale for $55 which was the lowest I saw for any 16gb rams. I actually got the DDR-2400 version but couldn't find it on PCpartpicker. ",5,memory
"32GB, 3200mhz. It works, and it looks good, too. ",5,memory
G.Skill ,5,memory
Look cool and stay very cool ,4,memory
They work great but they get a little hot. ,4,memory
Complements my CPU rather nicely when its all configured and running at its intended spec levels.  ,5,memory
Works fine. ,5,memory
Sharp looking RAM that gets the job done. ,5,memory
"Ram is Ram, and I read that DDR3L (low voltage) ram was suggested for skylake, so, why not? It runs cool, and very very fast. A bit tight snapping them into the mobo slots, and they feel fragile, but for 30$ and 8 gigs, it's good ram. ",4,memory
Good looking DDR. At first I looked at Ripjaws V but they seemed cheap and plastic so I went with Trident Z. No regrets. Solid and beautiful. ,5,memory
"Great quality! Go to corsair web site and buy there you get the light bars for free!
Amazon charges $35! Make the cost worth it.  ",5,memory
"No problem at all, with the new z170 platform I'm able to OC it to 3000Mhz ",5,memory
"Eh. It's RAM, it works. Good speed for DDR2, though you may want to spring for a 8 gig set. ",4,memory
"It's RAM, they're all basically the same, so I'll just give it 5 stars because I like the breathing red LEDs, they really stand out in my build. ",5,memory
"I told myself that i wanted to have RAM that had LEDs on it. I wanted them to light up and show off. Since DDR4 RAM if fairly new, it is hard to find DDR4 RAM that has LEDs build in. But then i found these gems. With no previous reviews, and no images on PCPP, i was a little spooked, But if your looking for LED DDR4 this is the one to go with. It also has the highest clock speed of any DDR4 LED RAM that i could find. ",5,memory
I chose 2 sticks of 4GB DDR3-1866 Corsair Vengeance LP RAM for my build. I went with Low Profile RAM was chosen so that the CPU heat exchanger can be mounted in any orientation and not clash with the heat spreaders on the RAM. I like the blue anodised finish on the heat spreaders even though it doesn't particularly match with anything else in the system. 8GB is about the standard for gaming these days and with these 2 units in place I doubt that I will need to add additional memory to my system. The only case that I can see for more memory in this PC is if I get into more serious photo and video editing. ,5,memory
"Does what it says on the tin. In retrospect, I think I would have gone for 2x4GB instead, to get better dual channel use. I'll likely buy another stick of 8GB to round out the system better.  In retrospect, I would have likely gone for more budget RAM, to better suit this build. ",4,memory
"Simple choice really. Fast, easily overclock, looks mean and was reasonably priced at the time of purchase. I wanted something that performed well and looked nice with the black and red of the motherboard. ",5,memory
"I have nothing to say about this Ram, does it's job really well with no issues. ",5,memory
"It's RAM, not much else to say. Hasn't died on me yet. Looks good and comes in different colors if aesthetics are important to you. ",5,memory
Originally wanted 3000 CAS 15 but wasn't available so got this instead. It's stable and looks a lot nicer than Fury series. XMP works great. ,5,memory
"Neither stick was dead, and they both perform as they should. ",5,memory
Bootyfull. ,5,memory
"Great price, 2400mhz is fine, looks good! ",5,memory
"At this time I really wanted to get the red g skill ripjaws 8GB CL9 although it was out of stock at the time, so I just went with this one. Still happy with it as it suits the look pretty good too! ",4,memory
Very difficult for me to get running at advertised speed. Was about ready to RMA it and go back to Ripjaws X 8GB. I knew a BIOS tweak was in order before I purchased. This is probably just mostly a localized MoBo model issue   I had to set CPU NB and HT Link frequencies both to 2400MHz before I could even boot windows successfully. TY interwebs. ,5,memory
"Great looks and no problems with it, so far! ",5,memory
"Disappointed in Walmart for saying it was CL9 RAM when in reality, it was CL11...  (1 star off) It's not fancy & decorated. It just does what it need to do. Great for a RAM I got for free. ",4,memory
"Not sure where the overclocking review are coming from, but my particular kit doesn't cooperate with increased frequencies or tightened timings. Will be upgrading to a proper quad-channel kit in due time. Only advantage of these is the low voltage and low profile (great for small form-factor builds, not for workstations) ",3,memory
"Nice ram. But only nice if you are planning on using the stock cpu heatsink, a AIO cooler or a small air cooler because the cooling fins on this ram are quite tall. Coolers like the Noctua NH-D14 will not fit without modding it. ",3,memory
It's 8 GB of RAM - cheap. ,5,memory
"overall the best RAM I found during my research. After I finished the build - I'm very happy I didn't cheap out on this, and with 16GB, I won't have to worry about anything, likely for the lifetime of the build. ",5,memory
Can never go wrong with G.Skill ram. ,5,memory
"Had issues, after some testing we discovered I had a bad stick. Manufacturer replacement and another bad stick! A second replacement and I was back in business. No issues since. A whole lot of waiting. ",4,memory
Its ram. The red looks good. ,5,memory
"Pros: runs at native speed of Kaveri-based APUs and Athlon FM2+ chips, works with XMP 1, heat spreaders do something, CAS 9!  Cons: none Quick take: this is a great budget option for FM2+ gaming and everyday use, very pleased! ",5,memory
"Bought this to replace the equivalent Corsair Vengeance LPX kit that I purchased that had a bad stick on arrival. Works great, looks pretty nice too. ",5,memory
Not too much to say. Its a RAM kit and it works. Mainly got them because they look good. ,5,memory
Good RAM and inexpensive if you buy on promo like I did ,5,memory
"Works great, chose because of the low timings and black color. ",5,memory
"Working great, CAS 10 ",5,memory
,5,memory
Just okay. I bought these becasue the metal heat sinks seemed cool and i liked that the ram was similar to the gold theme of my motherboard...but wish I had got ram with higher latency...Perhaps the G3258 is hindering the ram OC but I cant seem to keep my system stable above 1600mhz OC...at 1866 its sucks. Either way they were $55 and I will add another module at some point. ,3,memory
"Paying only for looks. A decision I don't regret as they do look fantastic, once they start working. One stick randomly didn't light up for 3 minutes, worked fine as memory just no lighting effect. Performance wise they are sub par compared to any other memory, most at half the price. Their XMP profile is buggy, and manual overclocking was required to make use of them.  ",2,memory
"Great RAM as far as I can tell, no issues whatsoever. ",5,memory
"Still is RAM, high CAS, average clock speed. Pretty average. ",4,memory
Does what it's supposed to. ,5,memory
"Stable,  looks good. Not much to say. ",5,memory
"Great, super fast ram.  Not much else to say. ",5,memory
It works ,5,memory
Amazing ram for the price ,5,memory
High quality RAM at a good price. Nothing else to say. ,5,memory
Fast and i like blue ,5,memory
"There was a sale at my work, so I took the opportunity to grab a pair and knock a part off my list. Got it for $30. I was happy and so was my wallet. ",5,memory
Great ram. Enough capacity and 1600mhz is plenty fast. Plus the heatspreaders look awesome! ,5,memory
It's RAM...and it works.  The red looks great on the motherboard. ,5,memory
"Sexy, which is pretty much the only thing that matters in ram as long as you have enough. ",5,memory
It's Ram and it works haha. Would recommend an extra 8 though. ,5,memory
"Great, fast RAM ",5,memory
Best DDR3 RAM on the market. Also one of the cheapest. I must note that this RAM is extremely appealing to the eye. You'd be stupid to not buy this RAM if red fits your theme. ,5,memory
"Good Memory, 32gb at 2400, not the best, but pretty good for my needs, not buying high freq ram anymore, i prefer capacity. ",4,memory
Thick. ,5,memory
"Good, fast RAM. Does the job nicely and not as large heatsinks as other RAM. ",4,memory
Just works and looks pretty nice ,5,memory
RAM is RAM. What can I say? ,5,memory
Very nice and fast ram.  I have had this ream for quite a while now and I have never had an issue with it. ,5,memory
"Not much to say... good reliable RAM. Choose it because Corsair is a very reputable brand, and matched color scheme. No problems yet, works perfect. Was a bit spendy  when I bought, and probably not worth it for looks alone. Still great RAM however. ",5,memory
"Never had any problems, but a bit pricey when I bought them (~2 years ago). ",5,memory
"Bog standard ram kit. Ran it 6 months as a starter kit in my build then popped it into a backup/htpc and have used it bi-daily for another 6 months. Small and slow kit but more than enough for htpc, light web browsing, and data backup. Solid 3 stars. ",3,memory
Great fast cheap dual-channel ram ,5,memory
"It was ram, but by now the price is too high for this amount. Get more RAM; you may not need more than 4 GB, but if you're gonna spend this much, might as-well get more, right? ",3,memory
"Not much to say, work as supposed, make a nice color scheme imo.  Maybe I could overclock it for some higher iGPU performance, tho I’ll have to get the cooler first so I can also overclock intel graphics. ",5,memory
This ram is great for a budget build because of its price but later on you might want to add another stick just to run games nowadays. ,3,memory
"Works great, gets the job done and doesn't cause issues. ",4,memory
"Kingston... how awesome you are. Runs great, has heat spreaders and work as advertised. Got it as a package deal off a bud. As you might have noticed... lots of my stuff is from a bud, lol, spare computer parts left over from his Dogecoin mining days. :P ",5,memory
Can not complain here. Great RAM at a great price. I have mine on XMP Profile 1 which runs them bad boys at 2800mhz. Stable all day. ,5,memory
This RAM gets the job done and is pretty inexpensive has been working over a year now no problems ,5,memory
"I like the looks, but kinda iffy on the price. ",4,memory
"I wanted at least 16GB because I planned on gaming and doing amateur video editing/streaming. I referred to the officially accepted RAM GB had noted that should work with the Gaming 7. Most every name brand ram I initially wanted was sold out at the time. So I gambled on A-Data. Was a little worried that its voltage was a tad higher but hey I wanted 2400 so I think most voltages are 1.65  Installed easy and the heatsinks seem REALLY sturdy. Not that bad looking in the board adds a metallic flair that I like. Got it setup dual channel and it was recognized as 1600 when I put it in. Went in the bios, found the XMP profile 1 and its all good now ",5,memory
Does what it's suppose to do. ,5,memory
"Awesome RAM, WHITE LEDS OMG It works, temperatures are good, get it ",5,memory
Good performance RAM with very nice pulsing effects for the LEDs (easy on the eyes).  Just be aware of the added height when purchasing your cooler. ,5,memory
"Fast, stable and good looks Just make sure to check the speed in your bios, mine keeps reading as 1600  ",4,memory
its ram it is yellow it works ,4,memory
ram with heat spreaders that don't reach for the sky. Viper sticker included. ,5,memory
"Bought these years ago, and I have no complaints. Can only run with 1400MHz in the current build. ",5,memory
Basic RAM. Easy to OC. ,5,memory
1600mhz cas 9. Works. Bang for buck ,5,memory
"I got it for only $35, and it gets the job done, not the most reliable company though. ",4,memory

It's RAM... was cheap. ,5,memory
"There isn't much to say here, I have got it overclocked to 2133mhz at 1.65V and its stable. ",5,memory
G-Skill delivers as always. Never had a bad module from them and this model is specifically listed in the Asus x99-A manual as compatible. ,5,memory
Looks good and performs well. The lights really added to the build and 1866Mhz is a plus. ,5,memory
It worked ,5,memory
"Oh just some handy dandy RAM, works great, don't really care for colorful heat sinks.  I think people pay extra for looks but in all honesty this ram has worked with no problems and doesn't get ""hot"". All in all great product.  Didn't have to travel to far to the local computer shop, IO software for $45. ",5,memory
Good price alot of  memory ,5,memory
Unfortunately ram price has boosted up and is overall 10-20 dollars more expensive than months ago so this is the best I can get. Not a popular brand but runs at 3000mhz steadily. ,5,memory
Great ram. stable and works. ,5,memory
so far so good! I've never used this brand of Memory before. ,5,memory
"Needed 16GB worth of ram and this does the job nicely. Honestly, I got this particular one because it was orange to match my scheme. lol ",5,memory
G-Skill Ripjaws V DDR4 3200 can't be overclocked in MSI X99a SLI-PLUS MB. ,4,memory
"This RAM was rather cheap when I bought it and that is why it surprised me when I installed it and unbeknownst to me it has LEDs. Which for me was awesome because my entire battlestation is black and blue, so the blue LEDs made the purchase even sweeter. But from a performance perspective, this ram is just standard at 1600 MHz so it's everything you will ever need unless you're running an APU build or really, really care about benchmarks, in which case a faster clock speed would be beneficial.  Be sure to download the Ballistix mod utility if you want to change the lighting speed and pattern as well as if you'd like orange lighting because this offers that as well. ",5,memory
Had it in the spare parts bin and it was better double the original 4GB. ,5,memory

Fits under nhd 15. ,5,memory
"Not much you can say about Corsair RAM, it just works! The DIMMs come stock underclocked at 1333MHz, which works just fine for me, but you can definitely bump them up to the full 1600MHz in the UEFI if you need it. ",5,memory
"Pretty solid. Haven't had any issues, excellent for heavy apps like adobe after effects and premiere ",5,memory
works well ,5,memory
"What can I say about this? It's fast and it looks awesome. Is the plasma tube thing a little over the top? yes. Completely unnecessary? yes.

high performance high speed never had a problem ,4,memory
"I got these for $49 after tax which is pretty standard for cheap DDR3 RAM currently (June 2016). However, this was a better deal than some of the other cheap RAM options. This comes with a built-in heatsink and it's very compact. It's not flashy but it's RAM and it works. This brand, Mushkin, also sells the same RAM in an ""eco"" version which apparently uses less energy - it was the about the same price and I wish I jumped on that. Since this memory isn't listed on here currently at an affordable price (currently $110+) be sure to use a search engine to look on another website for this product or the eco version. ",5,memory

"RAM that lights up, I'm in.  ",5,memory
I decided to go with G. Skill TridentZ because it was on the qualified vendor list and matched the color scheme of my mobo so seamlessly. This also leaves enough room for me to upgrade to 64GB in the future. You know what they say about systems with large memory? Big sockets. ,5,memory
Hard to get set up. Wouldnt run at 2400 with XMP enabled with a 4790k@4.9GHZ. ,4,memory

I wanted to go for 16 gb as it seemed to be the current sweet spot in terms of performance, price and future proofing. ",5,memory
Functional and completely black. Works great! ,5,memory
"Cheaper than the standard Ballistix Sport when bought, and comes with snazzy blue heatsinks. RAM is RAM, for the most part, just get whatever's cheapest from a reputable manufacturer. ",5,memory
"Looks really nice and simple and pretty much basic ram for little money. I got this ram for about $44 dollars but sometimes it drops down to$33 which is a stellar deal. It is not at the baseline speed of 2133 mhz in  the DDR4 group, though just the average I suppose but overall this is some really nice and simple for all my needs. ",5,memory
"This is pretty standard ram, gonna look into upgrading it next. Works really well though. ",4,memory
"No issues with it. Have had the same single stick in my main machine for about a year now and haven't had any slowness, and it still works. I was originally going to buy a totally fresh 16GBs when I upgrade but I might just get another one of these. ",5,memory
"It's RAM, looks nice and does what it's supposed to! ",5,memory
"Build quality and design of the RAM and heat spreaders are good. Works as you'd expect, no problems so far. Priced fairly well, a sound buy for 2x8GB RAM users. ",5,memory
"Doesn't seem like many places sell these sticks, but they're good for the price. The heat spreaders look pretty nice and feel pretty tough. ",4,memory
They work as intended. Make sure that your heatsink if you are using one can support these haircomb heatspreaders. ,5,memory
"Great for budget builds, stable and cheap. ",5,memory
"Cheapest DDR4-3000 I could find, can't really complain about anything. ",5,memory
"I stuck to the basics when it came to RAM for my build. Since my motherboard hits its memory bandwidth limit at 2400MHz, I went for the cheapest option I found and I limited my purchase two sticks to give me the option to expand if I start working with larger files later. None of the RAM kits currently available in 2x16GB configurations hit my previous CAS/size requirements, so I stuck with 2x8GB for now. Oddly, UEFI/BIOS recognize this RAM's bandwidth at 2133MHz, and the decorative sticker that came on the RAM is pretty low quality stuff. ",3,memory
"It's cheap, it's reliable, it looks pretty good in my case, there's a lot of it. Enough said. ",5,memory
"Handles well, I am sure I will buy another 16 GB of the same. ",5,memory
"It was blue RAM on sale, no problems. ",5,memory
"Its RAM, its cheap and it works, also it came in red which suited my build. ",5,memory
"Decent budget ram, standard 1866Mhz clock speed, runs cool, stays quiet. ",4,memory
G-Skill Ripjaws V DDR4 3200 can't be overclocked in MSI X99a SLI-PLUS MB. ,4,memory
"Working really well on single channel, a second one can only be a whole lot better! ",5,memory
"fast speed, looks good 8gb of ram ",5,memory
"Great performance but still good looks for any build. It's a shame you can't turn off the white LEDs, but having 4 or even 8 of these together creates a really solid aesthetic. ",5,memory
"Nothing special. Every stick of ram I've bought to date is from Team, all worked fine without trouble, this one included ",5,memory
Was pleasently surprised to find out that these sticks came with slowly pulsing yellow LEDs. Really like the style. The memory has been rock solid and I plan to use Avexir in future builds. ,5,memory
