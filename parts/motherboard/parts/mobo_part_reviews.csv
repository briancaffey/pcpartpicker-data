"I was nervous to flash the bios after reading about several people that had bricked their boards by doing it wrong, but it worked like a charm. It has a lot of good fan power placements around the board. The SLI setup is pretty good as well! ",5,Motherboard
"Does not have hot swap.  IPMI firmware needs to be upgraded before it works, contact supermicro directly, the website has out of date firmware.  Requires 4-pin fans for speed control.  Other than that no issues with this board. ",4,Motherboard
"When Asus says Deluxe, they meant it. Everything about this motherboard screams quality - easy to work with, tons of features, excellent documentation. I may never use half of what this mobo can do, but I'm glad I have it. ",5,Motherboard
"IDK anything about this board but it works, wish it had more features but it's a business class board and held up pretty well up, so I'm happy. oooooooh also this is the only build with this motherboard so I feel specccccccccccccccial ",5,Motherboard
"I had a bad board, but i bought it second hand. New Board seems to be much better, and it allowed me to update the BIOS. I may steer clear of Asrock in the future though... It does however OC well, and the BIOS is easy to navigate.  ",3,Motherboard
The motherboard was a mandatory pick for the 1155 socket. This socket doesn't have any great value motherboards. The BIOS is fair. I've picked up compaints about audio quality coming from my mic that were not existent prior to upgrading to this motherboard. The USB and 3.5mm jacks are not the highest quality. The best part of this motherboard is the Intel sound when booting. ,4,Motherboard
"I had to RMA this at 4 months, works now... will update stars when more time goes by... ",2,Motherboard
"This was a pretty good deal at the time. The BIOS is pretty easy to navigate, with many OC options. The system fan controller, Fan Xpert 2, was lacking some features, but I worked around them by lightly modifying the profile files. One feature I’ve found to be extremely helpful is the BIOS Direct boot hardware button. I’ve needed that a few times when I got stuck in bootloops while testing tolerances. If you plan on overclocking on a UEFI system, make sure it has this. The biggest downside is that the extra two SATA ports are Asmedia and do not connect with the Intel RAID controller. This gave me some headaches with some configuration tests. The Asmedia ports are not bootable, but can be unmounted from an OS. The hot swap for these ports don’t always like to cooperate. I’m currently only using one for my ODD; so far no problems with that. ",4,Motherboard
Far too expensive for my use case. I suppose it's great if you're going to do some more serious overclocking. ,4,Motherboard
my first one the capacitor blow up so i had to buy a new motherboard but this one works fine it got all the inputs i need  ,4,Motherboard
"Great board, only issue I have noticed is that I can't use more than 4 storage drives on the board at the same time. This may be a windows issue though. Not sure but still works perfect. ",5,Motherboard
Easy installation of components.  Plenty of SATA and Fan connectors.  Has a nice little 'Q Connector' that makes it easy to hook up your front panel lights and switches.  BIOS can configure things 12 ways from Sunday if overclocking is your passion. ,5,Motherboard
This motherboard had exactly what I needed for the price range. I have also bought gigabyte motherboards in the past so I felt confident with this choice. ,3,Motherboard
Worked well during time of ownership though the onboard audio was noticeably poor (hissing and crackling could be heard in the background). ,3,Motherboard
"Very basic board lacks major features of its A68,78,88 brethren like USB 3, Sata 3, built in WIFI. It has the bare basics PCI-E 3.0 x16, Gigabit Ethernet, and UEFI Bios. Great for a budget build and for those who want simplicity. ",4,Motherboard
"Not a whole lot to say, it works right and has the right settings to overclock. IO has all the features  I wanted.  BIOS is kind of clunky. ",4,Motherboard
"Would I change it if I could go back? Yes. Was purchased refurbished. The audio was okay in Windows 8, but since 8.1 has been a nightmare, this chipset is not well supported at all. Barely works in Windows 10, and that's with some serious dicking around with the drivers. Drivers have been a bit annoying since day one, the VIA audio makes me miss my old Realtek chip. Audio chip is most of the contempt I have for this board. At this time the ACPI restart function does not work. It shuts down, screen and keyboard go dark, but it never boots back up. Have to reset it. With quick boot on and a USB keyboard, accessing BIOS setup can be difficult. That's typical, but still annoying. ",2,Motherboard
"This board has everything I need and has performed great. M.2 for expansion, Solid placement and layout of headers, and a easy to use and update BIOS. Only downside is the lack of an LED or post Sound and could have some more fan headers other than that has been great.  ",4,Motherboard
love this board. BIOS rocks ,5,Motherboard
"Had an issue with the BIOS, wouldn't POST but luckily I didn't have to do a BIOS upgrade with my CPU and a bootable USB got everything working for me! can't complain since everything is well space and easy enough to access  ",4,Motherboard
"This has to be one of my favorite parts of the build.  It just looks tough, has a great BIOS and I love that I can flash things at the push of a button or load the BIOS at the push of a button.  Very heavy duty and makes the insides look pretty.  The USB 3.0 slots are a bit picky at times and gave me quite a few problems when trying boot from my thumb drive which is the only reason why it gets 4 instead of 5.  ",4,Motherboard
One of the cheapest Skylake boards. Amazing features for the price and it works. Skylake board? PCI Express 3.0? Decent audio? $60!? Sold. ,5,Motherboard
"Has every feature I need it to have, plenty of usb. However I could not connect the front panel audio, which isn't a huge deal because I don't use it anyways. Also there's an orange light constantly flashing, but other than that it works as advertised. Stays 25-40C. ",5,Motherboard
"Drivers weren't compatible with Windows 10, and has almost no Overclocking potential, but it works. ",3,Motherboard
"My dad got this at the same time he got the 8320e for me as a Christmas present. It's $10 after the $40 Micro Center combo discount and $30 MIR. $100 total and I got an upgrade that costs only as much as an i3 by itself. The actual board? I have absolutely no complaints about it. Others may hate the red, but I don't really mind it. This board comes with 2 CPU fan headers and 4 system fan headers (CPU1, SYS2 and SYS4 headers are all PWM, the others are 3pin headers). It supports the 9590 and 9370 (if for some reason you wanted to do that). ",5,Motherboard
I purchased this motherboard for a couple of reasons. I like that it's all a satin/matte black and it doesn't have any video outputs on it which helps reduce confusion to non-PC users on which port to plug their monitor into. ,5,Motherboard
"A good enough motherboard for me. This was the toughest choice of the build, but I decided to leave myself open to the possibility of getting a second 980ti in the future. I've had no problems at all with it and I haven't been left wishing I had any other features. ",5,Motherboard
"I have to take a star off because I couldn't get my CPU cooler's lower mounting stands to fit in all the way. Aside from that it's great, and BIOS was fairly easy to navigate. ",4,Motherboard
"Good board, does what is asked and has plenty of options for overclocking. ",5,Motherboard
Good all-around motherboard. Has all features that I need. Just wish it had a few more chassis fan ports. ,5,Motherboard
"This is an Intel B150 motherboard so overclocking and super fast memory is pretty much out of the question.  It has amazing onboard audio though, and I'm coming from a Creative Soundblaster-Z in the old system which exaggerated the bass unnecessarily and overwhelmed the rest of the sound. This is crystal clear and wonderful at any volume, with headphones or big speakers.  The green LED  lighting is exactly what I was looking for. Gigabyte offers some software for ""breathing"" animation with the LED lights and such which I might play with at some point. ",4,Motherboard
My video clip for the build  ,5,Motherboard
This board was only intended for the Optical out. Everything else on it was a bonus. The reason why I chose is only I support Asus and their products. So far im happy with this mobo....OH and I must say the BIOS is great for OC VERY user friendly!!!! ,5,Motherboard
"I saw this mobo on a 'weekly sales' list, and I immediately fell in love with it. I've never had an MSI product before, but I didn't hear any specific bad about it either. So there wasn't too much to think about.
The BIOS menu is heaven compared to those old, blue 8-bit designed dull ones. Everything's easy to find, easy to handle. And the software support is just awesome. I remember I had to deal with every single driver, bios update repeatedly. Hate it. Now it's just one click, and everything's taken care of. Including the bios update. I'm sorry, I'm just sold. ",5,Motherboard
"Little confused at first in the BIOS, but worked my way around it. Let me tell you if you haven't built a computer before the instructions for this MB are difficult to understand... (Where to put things) If asked i will put a picture up. ",4,Motherboard
"Does the job well, have not had any issues and I like the color scheme (Only with the -A variant). Hard to find in the socket 1150 range, especially that is still selling.  ",4,Motherboard
"Either I am very noobish or my motherboard doesnt want me to put in my own voltage settings for overclocking, that is why i give 3 stars. ",3,Motherboard
"Good budget X99 board.  You do not have to sacrifice too much while saving money.  My only complaint is that I ended up running out of USB 2.0 headers between my Cosair PSU, Cooler, and front panel USB.  Overclocking ability may not be the best but I was able to get my i7 5820k to 4.5GHz on this board. ",5,Motherboard
It is definitely a above average mobo but installing the software is a pain hint to anyone buying it you have to look through hardware files till you find a install wizard for it and if you cant find it there good luck finding it on the website. Otherwise its a great mobo with great features making it a real competitor to other mobos at its price range ,4,Motherboard
"I don't have much knowledge on these, but BIOS was user friendly and we were able to install everything quick after PC started, except the fact it is not compatible with Windows 7, and we spent so much time trying to figure out why it wouldn't install... Installed 8.1 super fast and then upgraded to 10. ",4,Motherboard
"My version didn't have WIFI, but only cost £61.82 after cashback. This is a really well-designed Mini-ITX board with many high-end features: SupremeFX audio, Intel 1219-V LAN, M.2 socket with 4xPCIe 3.0/NVMe, Fan Expert 2+ and so on. Unusually, there is a Water Pump header in addition to CPU and Chassis fan headers. All have selectable PWM or DC control. I used the Water Pump header for the front fan  The layout is excellent with all major connectors on the back edge. The PCIe socket is well clear of the memory slots and the CPU socket has plenty of clearance all round. Be aware though that the M.2 socket is on the rear of the board and not accessible when the board is installed. The LED lighting was quite restrained but no doubt will appeal to some. ",5,Motherboard
"A good motherboard with reasonable connectivity. Not the cheapest, but I'm okay with paying a bit of a premium for aesthetics. ",5,Motherboard
"I bought this because I just wanted something simple, yet powerful enough for a bit of overclocking headroom. Now that it's working it's exactly that, but it would not boot with any of my Crucial RAM sticks in the slot closest to the CPU. I changed out the Crucial for Corsair and it works fine, but I wasn't expecting that kind of weird compatibility issue from what's supposed to be a robust enthusiast product.  Add to that the fact that it doesn't have Wi-Fi, M.2 storage, or many of the other things that have become standard on other boards, and this board is hard to recommend at its MSRP. Fortunately I got mine on sale and it was pretty much the cheapest Z170 itx board I could find. ",3,Motherboard
An excellent mini-ITX motherboard with a ton of features. The wireless antenna provided is top-notch as are the more motherboard-bound things. ,5,Motherboard
Worked and overclocked nice ,5,Motherboard
It has got everything. ac wifi and bluetooth 4.0. A88 chipset. USB 3.0 headers and on-board. 4 SATA3 ports. The only annoyance is its live USB ports that are supposed to provide charging while its off. Can't figure out how to turn it off. There is a driver and utility to turn it off but I haven't had enough time to research it.  I would highly recommend this board. ,5,Motherboard
"Fine sturdy motherboard, I was a bit rough with it during the installation, but didn't break anything, its definitely a good piece of equipment. ",5,Motherboard
"Sweet board that could overclock the cpu, and had a front usb 3.0 connector which was good for its price.  ",5,Motherboard
"Very sturdy and reliable. It's got a bunch of features that I'll probably never use, but it's nice to have. P.S. It does have a big red number at the bottom, so it might clash with some builds. It wasn't nearly good enough of a reason to drop a star though. ",5,Motherboard
"Overall, a really great motherboard for what you pay for. M.2 20Gb/s, USB 3.1 and Type C, reinforced PCI-E slots, VRMs run really quiet. Bios is absolutely terrible. Mouse cursor is extremely buggy, so if you try moving it quickly it will glitch out and not move correctly. It's also pretty much impossible to get my RAM to run at stock frequencies. They're currently stuck at 1600Mhz, when they're advertised to run at 1866. Trying to overclock them results in a boot failure / crash. ",4,Motherboard
"At first I was planning to buy the same motherboard just with H170 chipset. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) in my country H170 variant was just ~10€ cheaper, so there was no point in buying it. All the features I wanted: couple of SATA3, M.2 slot on the back (for now I am not gonna use it), although only one 4-pin CPU power connector, not gonna extremely overclock in HTPC case anyways... ",5,Motherboard
,4,Motherboard
"I wanted to upgrade to the 1151 socket and I was trying to find the best/cheapest option on the market. Nothing fancy but its a z170 chipset. I will take it. I was going for mATX but I found the ATX on sale. Get the size that suits you with a z170 for ""future-proof upgrades"" to a better CPU in time. ",4,Motherboard
"Originally, we had decided to purchase a Gigabyte Z170x-UD3. This decision was based on features, decent reviews, and the price (180 CAD at the time). After getting the UD3 home we discovered that installing an M.2 SSD in the main port would cause it to be covered by the GPU exhaust. It’s like they were literally trying to get us to sandwich the NVMe SSD into the board with the side of the GPU, it was ridiculous and the heat could cause the SSD to throttle. Using the other M.2 port would disable many of the SATA ports. We assumed the UD3  So far the UD3 Ultra has performed well and given us no issues. I feel like it has some nice features and ""future proofing"" that aren't available in other boards at this price point. The blue lighting effects are cool if you want them or they can be turned off (Solid, Pulse, Off). There are no other colours. I wasn’t going too much for looks as far as the inside is concerned but I do say it is neat looking at it glow sometimes. The Ultra is slightly larger than the basic UD3, so it covers all the motherboard stand-offs, and is sturdy when installed. (Reviews of the basic UD3 indicated the one edge awkwardly hangs free).  After buying the Ultra, a free Thunderbolt 3 driver update was added. I don't know what to use it for, but it's great to have for the future. This is also a standard USB-C 3.1 port. I imagine later down the road some of my backup solutions will take advantage of it, so it's nice to know it's there and ready. The USB-C port can supply up to 100 W. Again I don't know what to use it for, but it's great for the future. I can fast charge my Nexus 6p but I don't use it regularly. There is a DisplayPort mini input that can be used to take the output from a graphics card and feed it through a TB3 connection. I haven’t tested it yet. The SATA / PCIE SSD interactions were more straight forward than the basic UD3. Check the manual for your exact configuration, but generally each PCIE x4 drive disables 2 SATA ports. There more USB 3.0 ports at the back than the basic UD3. Our case only has 2 USB 3.0 ports in the front, and the UD3 Ultra provided exactly that number. There is a USB 3.1 Type A port at the back Plenty of fan headers and some can switch between PWM and Voltage control. Decent GPU spacing. U.2 port adds another connection type for PCIE x4 SSDs. XMP didn't work on the shipped firmware. Version 5 should fix the issue. I downloaded the beta (5b) and it's working without issues. The BIOS isn't as intuitive as I would like, but it's probably not any worse than other Gigabyte boards. I completed a manual overclock to 4.6 GHz, but couldn't figure out how to enable adaptive voltage. With an automatic overclock in the BIOS to ""i7-6700k 4.6 GHz"", it does utilize adaptive voltage, so I stuck with that. It's a hard to tell how the board is setting the Vcore voltage because of droop under load (~1.275) and otherwise low values from adaptive voltage. However, it's stable so far. Fan control in the BIOS is available, but the profiles are limited. The included software for windows can enable more complex profiles if you want them. Apparently the Realtek Audio codec is an older model than the one in the basic UD3. However, we output most audio digitally to the surround sound receiver. The Stereo 2.1 output to our other speakers did not have any quality issues. Maybe an audiophile would have more to say. I would recommend this board for up-to-date features (Thunderbolt 3, USB-C @ 100W, M.2, U.2) and aesthetics. The bonus of extra connectivity makes this a surprisingly good buy at this price point.  ",5,Motherboard
"One of the best mATX motherboard for skylake on the market. It has everything that I need. The only problem is that it can't detect the temperature of the GPUs. Since I don't have a fan controller, the PWM fans can only change their speed depend on the CPU temperature. I have to turn up the fans manually when gaming. ",4,Motherboard
"Some things were hard to find, but otherwise it's nice. Navigable BIOS. Unfortunately, it appears it won't give you much freedom in terms of overclocking, as it shows four frequencies (including stock).  ",4,Motherboard
"Solid build quality. I wish it had a couple more bells and whistles like an Intel NIC, but it doesn't get much better at this size and price range. EDIT: Turns out the RAM slot closest to the CPU is a bit loose. It's normally not an issue but it can cause the computer to lock up if bumped. ",3,Motherboard
"I don't know much about motherboards, but It's got a good I/O and it wasn't confusing to put into my build. Good in my book. ",4,Motherboard
Nice Mobo with lots of expansion options. It detected my RAM with no problems. LED lighting is great and sound quality is better than acceptable. ,5,Motherboard
Great board other than a bad IO shield. I had to unplug all SATAs to force it into the bios for setup.  ,3,Motherboard
Great motherboard to work with. Wish it had another fan header or 2 but for the money and features can't be beat. Will update after overclocking attempt. ,4,Motherboard
Decent Mobo. Got this for $57. ,4,Motherboard
"It looks nice, the manual the comes with it isn't the best and a lot of slots not labeled but still got it to work. I do like the surround sound feature built in. Probably will pick up a newer version of this motherboard in the future. ",4,Motherboard
"Looks wonderful, works great. Has plenty of ports and whatnot. Was completely plug-and-play on my Linux system. Had to push it up a bit against the I/O shield to get the screws lined up. The BIOS has lots of settings and is pretty. 10/10. ",5,Motherboard
IT LOOKS AMAZING! Good value and has pretty good i/o.  ,5,Motherboard
"Mobo: MSI B85M-E45 is cheap, has 4 slot of ram. The mobo doesn't matter much so.......yeah ",2,Motherboard
It's a great motherboard. Just wish it had more SATA cables. I have to stick with 2 drives.  ,4,Motherboard
"Good basic motherboard. I'm not an over-clocker, so the basic functionality provided by this board was good enough for me. The layout and connector placement is good, and I had no problems with my build using this board.   ",4,Motherboard
"Fully functional, I've had no issues with it at all. However it is not a standard-sized ATX board. It is narrower and sacrifices the right-most standoff screws that standard ATX boards have. Due to this, the board flexes and makes it difficult to plug in headers and the 24-pin ATX power cable on the right side of the board. Additionally, due to the narrower board and sacrificed space on the right side, the front audio port is on the very bottom left of the board, so it might not reach on cases with relatively short headers. ",3,Motherboard
Easy to work with full ATX motherboard.  Front panel headers are clearly labelled and color-coded to make installation quick and easy.  Provides more than enough ports for storage and USB2/3 connections. ,5,Motherboard
"This motherboard is awesome. It's extremely well built, and has everything you'll need to build an awesome system. (Even has dual PCI-e x16 lanes, which you can use if you have either the 5930k or 5960x). ",5,Motherboard
"Pros: 
Looks very nice and the new revision included a heat pipe between the north bridge and the VRMs.
Good heat dissipation temps in HWmonitor for the mobo around high 30's ~ low 40's under load (with good airflow 2 corsairs SP 120 on the front)
Supports Overclocking and has been very stable with it
The UEFI supports profiles Cons: Needs more Fan Headers!!!!! really!! are you kidding me!
I ended up using even the power fan connector, but had to use a low speed resistor adapter to minimize the noise since it runs at 100% all the time
Cpu core voltages were moving all over the place even when set static I know this also has to do with AMD architecture requirements but come on.
The UEFI is not that easy to use, its decent enough
The EasyTune software has very limited options for this mobo (I've seen pic of the software on other mobos) and looks like its from the 90's. The documentation is bad and the illustrations worst. Other Thoughts: 
Not the best overclocker but gets the job done.
Cpu Load line calibration can be quite useful just be careful with the setting you select. I recommend normal (which is what I'm using with my oc) or less unless you are water cooled. To me the biggest down side is the lack of fan headers the rest is not big deal. Its holding my 8350 at 4.4Ghz with air CM hyper 212 evo. ",4,Motherboard
"Great motherboard with everything I was looking for: X99 chipset, 8 RAM slots supporting up to 128GB, 2 M.2 slots supporting NVMe SSDs (although the 2nd M.2 slot will run in SATA mode with CPU with 28 PCIe lanes), USB 3.1 type C, dual gigabyte ethernet, and WiFi/Bluetooth. ",5,Motherboard
Bios looks sexy 10/10 -ign ,5,Motherboard
"The motherboard didn't give me any problems at all, did everything I asked for and did it perfectly! I didn't overclock on this motherboard so I can't leave any feedback on that. ",4,Motherboard
"Heard mixed things about this board. Haven't tried to overclock yet, but so far has worked great. UEFI on it is so simple and easy to work too.  ",5,Motherboard
"Absolutely beautiful board. Totally stable, weighs as much as a Sabertooth tiger, and eats children for breakfast. Would recommend. Would not recommend if you own children. ",5,Motherboard
"It's not ideal, but if you're budget is that tight it's a justifiable purchase.  Don't plan on overclocking with this motherboard,  I'd honestly recommend saving a little more and getting something else like the MSI 970 or gigabyte 970a-ds3p.  Also despite the pictures the real color is earwax yellow. ",2,Motherboard
"Great little board. Not many features in the bios, but whatever. It wasn't designed for that. The LEDs behind the board are kinda cool. Wish the white highlights showed up more.  ",5,Motherboard
"Asus Z170-K Motherboard works great, is pretty, and has an amber LED strip you can turn on and toggle how it lights up. However, the right side of the board, when mounted, seems unsupported and you will need to be careful mounting your RAM. I slid my 4 fingers under the board so it wouldn't bend much. Another small issue for me was how many fan connection points it has. Only 3, and that includes the CPU fan. To be clear, there is one CPU slot and 2 Chassis fan slots. While not a deal breaker, if you're running a liquid cooler all in one like I am, you're left with one spot for your case fans. Being from an electrical engineering background and having experience in doing this multiple times, I cut the last connector from each of my SATA power cables and soldered the +12V and GND lines to my 4 Riing fans. Leaving the 2 side fans on my window to use the last chassis slot to make it easy for removing the door. Not any good reason to remove a star. Great board IMO. ",5,Motherboard
"For the price you get quite a bit. I am a big fan of MSI boards because they really give you a lot for your money. 4k support, plenty of usb ports, dvi, hdmi, displayport, bluetooth, wireless ac, m.2. If I would have been more patient, I probably would have spent the extra money for the A88XI Version of this, but I wanted to buy all the parts and build in the same day. I Only wish the M.2 port was not in use so that I may put a nice PCIE drive in eventually. ",5,Motherboard
"Has pretty much everything but an optical output.  For someone who doesn't plan on overclocking and wants a solid budget board, you found it. ",5,Motherboard
"pros:
Extremely reliable
Intuitive front panel connectors
no coil whine
comes with screw and adhesive hardware and back I/O plate
comes with driver disc for on board device drivers. 
The user manual is VERY detailed and helpful.

Cons:
Only con I can think of is the color, brown. The color didn't matter much to me because the case I put it in doesn't have a window ",5,Motherboard
"Good:
Excellent motherboard, so far I have had no issues. Corsair LPX 3000MHz ram had its XMP profile recognized immediately for frequency and timings. Fan control options seem pretty extensive and there's an option for water cooling. 2 M.2 ports, 6 SATA ports. Decent and isolated sound card. Good looking board and the RGB LED's are a plus. Bad:
Only 5 USB ports total (not including USB-C port), had to add an expansion card. Overall a great purchase! ",5,Motherboard
"The motherboard, by ASRock, was a very nicely assembled piece of work - nothing felt poorly constructed about this board at all, and the layout was very logical. The UEFI BIOS was easy to use and logically designed. If I were to ding it for anything, it would be that I don't think it had enough fan connectors for a board of its class, and I also was mildly annoyed that it did not feature a heatsink on its VRMs - but this was at least mitigate-able via the cooling schema ultimately used.

I dont know if i will ever buy another brand of motherboard. i really like everything asus has done here.  ,5,Motherboard
If you plan on going with two or more GPUs then this thing is amazing. Not only is it a beautiful board but the orientation of the various connectors are great. If you don't plan on using sli or crossfire then don't get it. Save ~$100 on a board more suited to what you need. Glorious board! ,5,Motherboard
Great ITX motherboard. It has all of the features I needed. It has Wifi and it's pretty good. Orange color scheme looks nice as well.  ,5,Motherboard
"Good MoBo. It has an a88x chipset, supports 2600Mhz memory and Crossfire. It looks pretty good too! It loses 1 star because the download links in the support page wasn't working. I had to tell it to the support guys.  I got it for $82 before taxes. ",4,Motherboard
"Pros: OK desing. A complete BIOS (which is also easy to use). Crossfire X support. Supreme FX audio (5.1 ch). 4 ram slots, ATX.

"Not crazy about the fan header placement on this board. The lack of heatsinks on the VRMs also isn't terribly attractive or reassuring at the price this board was at. If I could go back I'd probably look at other B85 or H87 options. I realized after the fact I could have gotten an Asus B85 Vanguard for the same price with VRM cooling, more fan headers, and better USB 3.0 and fan header placement. With that being said the motherboard has been rock solid in terms of stability. ",4,Motherboard
"Good motherboard, lots of connections etc and decent heat dissipation. Visual look of the board as well is nice. Two things I would improve however: Booting takes considerably longer (like 60s) if external hard drives are connected at boot. Asrock were not very helpful when contacted regarding the issue... The SATA connectors can be a little fiddly with their stacked placement on the side of the board, it can be tricky to unplug cables once in place. ",4,Motherboard
"It's not the greatest of boards by any measure, but it was a good buy mostly due to the low cost, and the fact that it has 4 RAM slots. What's terrible, though, is Biostar's customer support. it took about a month and a half to complete the RMA process. ",4,Motherboard

"The motherboard and RAM came with the processor as a bundle. For whatever reason the motherboard keeps trying to run the RAM at 1333 speeds when set to auto so I've had to force it into 1600 mode.

As odd as it sounds but I can also hear data being moved around the RAM. I'm not sure if this is a motherboard or RAM issue but I originally thought it was just the hard drives. After removing both of the HDD I was still hearing this noise. The motherboard VRMs don’t come with head sinks installed so I took a block of scrap aluminum and fashioned some heat sinks for them. The TIM is Arctic Silver 5 (same for the CPU and GPU) since it is non-conductive I wasn’t concerned about a short. The heat sinks are held on with some bolts and nylon washers. Only two of the case fan headers allow for variable speed. Their speed is set in the BIOS and is constant regardless of temps. The other two just run at full speed.

"Very basic, plain X99 motherboard. Only 1x PWM fan control for CPU and only 1x PWM fan control for chassis fa. If you install CPU with 28 PCIe lanes (as I have with the 5820K), only the first slot will run in 16x and cannot be allocated to other slots. This board also only has 2x PCIe 3.0 16x, 1x PCIe 2.0 16x and 1x PCIe 2.0 1x slots and therefore no quad SLI/Crossfire Support. Onboard audio is pretty average and there is no onboard WIFI, bluetooth additional raid controllers (only Intel raid controller). ",3,Motherboard

"This thing is a Beast. I mean, it felt heavy and my gorilla fingers never felt like I would break it. 5 year guarantee is super nice. I really liked the built in fans in theory, but those things are loud. They are the only thing I can hear in my case. My roommate asked me what that noise was when I booted up for the first time. He was in a different room at the time.... ",5,Motherboard
"Great looking motherboard as well as solid value for a premium board.  Only complaint was no USB 2.0 headers (my case has 2 of them, plenty of USB 3.0s though) and the I/O cover interferes with the placement of Gpus in the top PCI slot. ",4,Motherboard
"This motherboard as went through many builds for me and has been a real trooper. I used to run a G3258 oc'd to 4.5ghz on this board. It's also very tiny, only about an inch longer than a mini itx.  ",4,Motherboard
"The X99 ASRock Fatality Killer gaming board is a very beautiful work of technology, with a nice red and black theme and a very heavy duty PCB, this board is built to last, the UEFI is very easy to navigate and allows for very easy over clocking with simple drop down predetermined OCs, with that said, it also allows those more experienced enthusiast  to go beyond just simple drop down menus and go all out and tweak to their hearts content.
with support for a total of ten Sata drives and one m.2 this board also allows for a vast amount of hard drives or SSDs. 
I loved the easy power and reset buttons, as well as the lcd display, that allowed me to test this mother board out side of a case to ensure it worked properly.
on the back side of the board is plenty of usb 3.0 slots a total of six of them to be exact, as well as two usb 2.0 with one dedicated as a gaming mouse port which allows for adjustments of your mouse. though this slot did give my simple gateway mouse some issues from time to time. also on the back side is your audio which is very clean and crisp, and for those with power hungry headphones the headphone slot is powered to allow for up to 600ohms of impedance, two Ethernet ports one being a Intel and the other being a killer gaming, which is supposed to prioritize packets. 
unfortunately those that choose to use the 5820k with only 28 lanes for PCI-E you will not be able to run three way graphics cards as this board does not feature a PLX chip, however those running the 5830k and the 5960x will be able to natively run three crossfire or sli cards as those CPUs feature 40 PCI-E lanes.

"Although I haven't used the software yet, the hardware is top of the line. I'm not a fan of the black and red styling, although it's what's expected of msi. It was easy to mod the board colours to black, which was helpful. The red ddr4 trace lines printed on the board look cool but are red :( So until I figure out how to colour or remove them I'm stuck.
The inclusion of an on board sound card and the wireless capability really sold this board for me, not to mention the other numerous functions like the easy overclock dial and the great software. The mobo armour  on the back is a big plus too. ",5,Motherboard

Motherboard. I've waited their mini-itx for a long time until I gave up and got this matx when it was on sale.

The motherboard I actually used is the GA-H110M-S2H =  When installing this in the Z3 chassis I had to move up the two bottom stand-offs for fitting the board inside.    Once fitted I removed the rear fan and turned it clockwise before re-fitting to give me just enough cable length to reach the fan header and keep things super tidy.  ,5,Motherboard
"Awesome motherboard with great overclocking features. Sharp-looking and well laid out. The audio seems particularly good, especially the headphone jack. Also, the dedicated audio power provided for external USB audio interfaces is appreciated because this is my audio lab PC. When my monitor was not recognizing video on first startup, I found the diagnostic feedback provided by the 2 LED display very useful to determine that the motherboard was working properly. The only slight issue I had was that the ethernet port is not recognized by Windows until the MSI drivers are installed. But that didn't cause any trouble, just a little initial concern.

- A lot of settings that I still haven't played around with or checked them out.
- Very easy BIOS and very simple to Overclock CPU and RAM Cons :
- Software and AI Toolkit is not that great for ASUS, ( I have known that because I had an ASUS before aswell ), other than that this is a great motherboard.
 - Also detected some weird temperatures, before motherboard flashing. ",4,Motherboard
I was tempted to use my usual H110m-Sh2 again for this build but opted to make the rig a lot more upgradable than my others and with the additional ram slots I've got room to get another 2x4GB kit while still keeping my existing 2x4GB sticks in play :) ,5,Motherboard

"The two things that irked me about this motherboard were the standoff locations (not full ATX, but I learned from that mistake) and driver installation.  I can live with the fact that the motherboard uses a mix of ATX and micro ATX standoff locations, just a mistake by me.  Installing the LAN driver is what gave me problems.  After updating the BIOS, the Intel LAN driver installer told me that I had no Intel adapters present in the computer.  With the help of Reddit, I was able to go into the device manager and manually install the driver on the ""unidentified device"" that was present.  This driver issue set me back a few hours, meaning I couldn't activate Windows or go further with the build.  But after that, I was able to get the PC up and running. ",3,Motherboard

"I will need more experience with this motherboard before I can award it the final star.  The BIOS seems rather overwrought, but maybe that's just the way of things in this UEFI era. One star off for the UEFI nonsense that kept Linux from booting, and which took me nearly two days to overcome. In all other respects, it's acquitted itself well.  It has tons of options, and the connectors are easy to get at. ",4,Motherboard
"I was a bit let down here. The bios features are great. The RAM slots are just barely too close to the socket for my comfort, although I think I could still JUST fit two more modules. Looks very basic, although for the price I wasn't expecting spectacular. The thing i didn't expect were the issues I had installing win7 from USB, while using a USB keyboard and mouse. I believe this may be all 100 series, but it's definitely more trouble than I wanted to deal with. Ended up getting a new retail win10 so I didn't have to rack my brain to fix this. ",3,Motherboard
"I had trouble making my pc work because of this guy right here. My pc would turn on but won't post so I did some tests like  even after the things I did above, it still didn't work so I'm starting to think that my mobo is a bad one. I didn't give up and this time, I removed the battery of the motherboard to reset its Bios and after a few mins, I placed it back and tried to boot my pc up with everything built up and it works! Now that it's working, I proceeded to install the os, and all the other stuff. The UEFI looks nice, but I haven't really tried tweaking things yet so I can't speak about the ease of use for it. The board shows some noticeable flex when I was plugging stuff on it while mounted on the case. The board is light and doesn't really feel high end, but I don't think it has a bad quality build.  For those who plan to use this motherboard, I hope this helps you and it is not my intention to prevent others on buying this since it is a nice looking motherboard for the price. I removed 1 star because of the hassle it gave me before I get it to start working. ",4,Motherboard

"No problems at all during the build, except for the issues that ended up being Microsoft's fault. Support was responsive and easy to work with when I called them. Board is laid out in a manner that didn't conflict with the build. 10 USB ports on back, support for the full 4 (2x2.0, 2x3.0) ports on the front of my case. No complaints. ",5,Motherboard
"I had a Classified E760 back when I had an i7 920, great board for its time, and having recently messed with newer ASUS and MSI bios, my expectations were high for EVGA. I was a bit disappointed, nothing fancy and flashy, but its extremely functional - exactly what you'd want from an overclocking board. I can't really ding it for that. However, I had to update my bios to install Windows 10? Something, somewhere was overlooked there. ",4,Motherboard
"Great, good looking MOBO. Bought online from Vuugo and was very pleased with the results. Time will tell it's overall quality but I'm pleased with it.  ",5,Motherboard
"Love this motherboard for my red themed build. The features and easy BIOS platform make this motherboard easy to use for even the newest of DIYers. The PCIe locations were not ideal for the Radeon R9 390 due to taking up three slots. I also do not like the placement of the USB pins, but that would have been fine if the 390 didn't cover the PCIe slot under the graphics card. ",4,Motherboard

"Best bang for buck Z97 board, IMHO. You get 8 channel audio, 4 USB 3.0 ports, stellar audio quality, support for up to 32GB RAM, CrossFire support, and its ""Ultra Durable"" (I didn't get round to test it by attempting to bend it). Get it while you can, not many Z97s left now. If you can get it for £50, as some places are offering, its a steal. ",4,Motherboard

The system has been running for two days now and will continue to run it for a few more days prior to passing it on to my Father-In-Law. But so far so good. The motherboard has all the right ports in the right places. The M.2 Slot is in the back of the motherboard which can be troublesome if problems ever arise. But so far the bios and drivers are all operating as intended. The Wifi works great in my home environment at least. The DDR3 memory support is a great option to keep costs down. Overall a great option for a Mini-Itx Build using the 1151 socket while still retaining DDR3 support. Now for the cons. As already mentioned the M.2 slot being in the back can be troublesome if problems ever arise with the drive. The IO shield is of terrible quality. Actually snipped a few of the weird things in there in order to fit properly and the sata cables included are extremely stiff. For a Mini-Itx board it would have been nice to see nice flexible cables being that this will clearly go into a small case. But I had some other more flexible and smaller cables sitting around to save my life. Overall highly recommended board for sure. ,4,Motherboard

"Great motherboard, not too heavy on the bling which was perfect for this build however is saying that I don't understand why it's not just all black, wouldn't this suit an RGB board better than having a static colour on it?. Anyways the heatsinks came off no issue and were easy to paint. The slot layout is flawless and software was easy to use for tweaking of LED colours but when I tried to connect the Phanteks RGB strip to this directly the colours came out wrong, I added a PH-CB_RGB4P adaptor though and everything was fixed :) ",4,Motherboard
"Cheapest board I could find that has DisplayPort. So far so good, though installation was tricky for two reasons: 1) The CPU mount has two crescent metal parts that make you think somehow they came loose and the back of the metal tension rod should be INSIDE when infact it's meant to be OUTSIDE. Tried like mad to get them to hook AROUND the rod but it's just really weird shaping. 2) Even though the guide shows that the RAM slots have a clasp that opens and closes on both ends, in fact only one end does that. I felt like I was going to break the RAM stick shoving it in. I guess they did it to save space given the size of the board, but I definitely felt like I was going to break something. After installation performance has been great. ",4,Motherboard
"This motherboard was giving me troubles at first; there was an issue with the RAM placement (although the board recommended it) and I was ready to RMA it, but I just knew there had to be some way to fix it, so I ended up having to clear the CMOS and re-seat the RAM and it worked.

"Has issues, can't put 48GB or 64GB of RAM b/c it won't boot, even at stock clocks, only 32GB or less works. This is unacceptable for a motherboard of this price bracket. ",1,Motherboard
"Great mobo - looks sick, too. Huge problem with it is the location of the CPU power connector. It was literally JUST far enough that I couldn't reach the cable to it. I had to wrap the wire under my PCI cards to reach across and plug it in properly. Plenty of space on it but no physical auto OC or BIOS reset buttons buttons. I just personally find them convenient. BIOS interface is nice and easy to use, and the mobo's layout is generic and simple. ",4,Motherboard
"This motherboard has everything I was looking for: it supports crossfire, RAID,  CPU overclocking, and also lets me use my DDR3 RAM with my skylake processor.  Only negative about this motherboard is that it only has 2 fan headers so I had to buy fan splitter cables for my extra fans. ",4,Motherboard
Lots of options for OC'ing. Fans are a little confusing to set up and it includes a 3.1 Type-C USB along with a M.2 bay. 4/5 ,4,Motherboard
"No issues so far, UEFI is nice, suitable for small overclocks ",5,Motherboard
"This motherboard isn't high end, by any means, and you can't really overclock too well on it (3+1 power phasing! can you believe it???). But then again, that's not a surprise at all, and this wasn't marketed as a high end mobo, by any means. I also don't really like the BIOS screen, it's pretty ugly. Also no USB 3. And, here's the big one, it actually doesn't support UEFI, it just uses plain old legacy BIOS. Doesn't really affect much, but legacy bios is reaaaly outdated. I didn't even think they made that kind of mobo anymore, but apparently they do. This motherboard actually is pretty old, however, and since I bought it on black friday it has gone out of production. However, for the ultra-low price, it's not too bad ",3,Motherboard
good budget board only complaint is the location of the case fan header is right in the middle of the board which makes routing the cable a nightmare. ,4,Motherboard
"Good Board, except I/O plate is not correctly aligned to all ports, especially the USB Type C port.
Asus AI Suite 3 software not much chop - better to setup case fan speed behaviour from the excellent UEFI BIOS.
Mobo drivers/utilities/documents should be available for download in one click (for initial build setup), rather than having to use all the individual download links. ",4,Motherboard
"My first SuperMicro motherboard. Although the packaging was not as flash as the more commercial brands, the board itself and its IPMI interface is fantastic. Was able to install this easily. The only minor considerations are the issues around the web interface always asking for Java version and the  mediocre I/O plate part around the LAN connectors. There are only 2 SATA3 ports but that's part of the spec and is not an issue. The USB onboard is great for booting Freenas from. Overall despite its minor flaws, this is a great board. ",5,Motherboard
"My first thing to say about this is, it looks badass. GB did a very nice job making sure all the ports were visible and accessible, installation of the IO shield was a breeze, and connecting the front panel IO could not have been easier. This is super easy to work with, comes loaded with features, and looks awesome. The BIOS is also great! It supports Intel XMP and is easy to navigate, but also offers an ""expert"" mode if you get tired of the BIOS for 5yos.  I've docked a star because on a gaming mobo of this price, I would have expected to see support for 4-way both CF and SLI. Nope! Only supports 2-way SLI and 3-way CF. Oh well, guess upgrade potential's just a tad limited...but in all fairness, >3 SLI or CF configs are downright unreasonable for the scaling you get. ",4,Motherboard
"An excellent motherboard with a black PCB and dark colours for the slots, it includes a handy IO clip for making things super easy during install and the USB Type-C is a big + for a board with such a low cost.  I like the position of the M2 slot just below CPU as well :) ",5,Motherboard
"It only has two RAM slots and the BIOS doesn't let you adjust the CPU voltage, but other than that, it's great. ",4,Motherboard
"Great aesthetic, fit in my build really well. Didn't have any problem. Great bios as well!  ",5,Motherboard
"Pricey, but fantastic looking motherboard. No issues with it at all.  ",5,Motherboard
"Great motherboard, no problems with it yet. Ran windows 10 out of the box. Has enough room for upgrades and is exactly what I was looking for in my build after looking at many different motherboards.  ",5,Motherboard
Beautiful and great motherboard. Full of useful features. ,5,Motherboard
"I don't need to overclock, so having an H170A motherboard isn't aproblem for me. It's a bummer that the RAM's clock speed is limited to 2133MHz. 2400MHz RAM was cheaper so I got that anyway. The motherboard's frontside audio connector is on the bottom corner completely opposite where the ports are on the case, so there's a wire running awkwardly across the bottom of the motherboard to connect it. ",4,Motherboard
"Very good, full of features and ports the only problem is not with the actual motherboard with the AMD chipset that doesn't support PCIe gen 3 which kinda sucks ",4,Motherboard
This MB makes it easy to overclock my CPU with game boost ,5,Motherboard
"One of the best H97 motherboards out there. I love ASUS motherboards, they totally have the best motherboard designs out there. ",5,Motherboard
"I went with Gigabyte because of the price, great reviews, and good looks. Gigabyte has a utility that allows you to make changes to the BIOS without having to load into the BIOS, pretty trick. ",5,Motherboard
"Went around the forums and looked for motherboards to overclock with. This one kept popping up, and since my color scheme for the interior lightning would be blue, I mean come on. On the plus side, it's just pretty. ",5,Motherboard
"Amazing Z97 board, really sad that they stopped making it. I managed to get this when they were trying to get rid of them, so I got it for under $130 which is a steal. It lacks some of the more modern features, so no USB 3.1, no M.2 slots (it does have MSATA), no NVME booting, but looking past that it's an amazing board. This is one of the last MSI ""gaming"" motherboards where MSI used a brown PCB. I'm not going to lie, it would definitely look better with black, but as long as you're not using white LEDs, you won't even see the brown. I really like the aesthetic of this board with the red accents, and the Black and Red I/O shield+I/O looks great with a black or red case. This board is packed with great enthusiast features that tend to get left out of boards under $175 or $200 these days. It has voltage checkpoints, dual bios, Debug readout, dedicated go to bios button (you have no idea how nice this is when you have fast boot enabled), buttons to start the computer from the motherboard, and voltage checkpoints with extenders that make it really easy to use. Maybe best of all is the 12 phase power design that's practically unheard of for a cheaper Z97 board like this one was. If you can find one of these, I would highly recommend it, as it's an amazing all around enthusiast board. ",5,Motherboard
"Had some trouble setting things up in the BIOS at first since I didn't realize it had both the onboard audio and PCi Graphics turned off at first for some reason, but it's fine now. ",4,Motherboard
All the bells and whistles of more expensive board without the price tag. Legendary ASUS build quality. ,5,Motherboard
"has a nice look and seems sturdy; has a fair amount of fan plugins, 4 ram slots, and a good amount of pci slots. ",4,Motherboard
It was $50 for me and it does the job brilliantly. The MSI version was around the same price but the Internet says Asus' quality is better so. One thing though is that it does not support Win 7 installation USB. I think it is a problem for Asus boards. ,4,Motherboard
"Does what I need it to do. Probably should have went with the asus axx pro, but hind sight is 20/20.  ",5,Motherboard
I wanted a ATX MB and a good brand. I think this MB is smaller than other ATX MB. You can only put in seven screws. ,5,Motherboard
"this motherboard looks great, and has tons of features, especially considering the price. the bios isn't my favorite but it still has all the options you need, my only problem i can think of is the fan headers, there is 2 pwm (4 pin) and 4 (3 pin) fan headers, of these the CPU fan headers are one of the 4 pins and one of the 3 pins, the mismatched fan headers wouldn't be much of a concern ( just use a fan hub) but the two CPU fan headers cannot be adjusted independently (as far as i can tell) this means if you want to run an AIO then you can max the pumps speed while letting the fans change speed. ",5,Motherboard
"Pro
affordable
has enough sata 
good for single card gpu con
no xfire/sli 
no overclocking
power pins may bend easy, causing my pc to turn on by itself once in a while ",4,Motherboard
"Looks amazing, has every feature you could ever ask for, runs stable with zero issues.  Flashed to latest BIOS before doing any tinkering or overclocking.  I feel this is the best high-end X99 board you can buy. ",5,Motherboard
"Excellent motherboard. Gigabyte's DualBIOS feature (which I was unaware of until this day) saved my butt the other day when I made a dumb mistake trying to overclock and couldn't boot because of a machine check error. So I fiddled with the switches and I accidentally switched to the backup BIOS and was able to boot up on default settings. I downloaded a fresh BIOS from Gigabyte and then re-flashed the main BIOS. If it weren't for that feature though, I would've been without a computer for a while, so kudos to them for that great feature.  I don't have any criticisms for this board. It has served me well for two years now. I am giving it four stars because $300 seems to be a little bit too much.  ",4,Motherboard
"Solid Motherboard. Wish there was a little more red vs the black, but that's nothing I couldn't tell you from the pictures. Everything is working well. It slightly concerned me that the Define R4 had ""A"" (for ATX) next to some Motherboard standoffs beside where this Motherboard sat, but that's... not really any kind of an issue. There's a little red lighting strip near the I/O which is a nice confirmation that it's running. ",4,Motherboard
A solid board for the money. No USB 3.0 headers on the MOBO but it does what I need and the BIOS is easy. ,4,Motherboard
Cheap and has USB 3 port for front panel. Would wait for the new line of budget processors released in late 2015 since AM1 will stop being supported. ,4,Motherboard
Beast of a board.  Simply hands down best of the best by Asus for the X79 platform.  I do wish  they would have made the board more server oriented seeings this was built from the ground up for Ivy Bridge-E processors on the X79 platform.. given 40 pcie lanes you would think they would have designed the board to be compatible 16x in all four slots. ,4,Motherboard
"The only thing I would add is that its a little small as seen in the pics. But thats not the products fault, as I choose it. But other than that it does its job with no issues. ",4,Motherboard
"the only x99 mitx motherboard. ultra fast boot is not very ultra fast, and it even gives me plenty of time to enter the uefi setup. as someone who likes fast, i am disappointed ",4,Motherboard
"Probably the best inbetweener motherboard out right now  (when I mean inbetweener, I mean in between medium/average grade MOBS and Top of the line MOBS) Has everything you need, providing you ample enough space for all your components. Only down star is that I would love for a MOBS to come out around this price range with wifi AC capabilities. ",4,Motherboard
Directions aren't too clear. Had to use others for some input on placement of cords. ,2,Motherboard
"Eghhhhhhh. Not again, I'll tell you that. This motherboard has 3 SATA ports now. the plastic housing on the 2nd SATA3 has left the building. Flashed the Bios, tried to use the Windows .exe from ASRock, not happening. Finally ballsed up and threw it on a FAT32 USBdrive, flashed it. Doesn't boot. Tries again. Nope. Finally realized what had happened. Went into the UEFI, unplugged my mouse, plugged it in again, went to boot devices changed it from my hatachi drive to my ancient Maxtor. Boots right up.

"Weak 4+1 power phase holds back overclocking potential, but has Crossfire capability, so there's that. It looks cool, too - dark PCB and heatsinks. UEFI BIOS leaves a bit to be desired compared to higher-end boards, but it's actually not bad. At least it's UEFI.  ",3,Motherboard
"This motherboard doesn’t support the ability to overclock and at the time I didn’t know that I should’ve gotten a z97 version of this board. Other than that, this board is really amazing the bios is really simple to use. At first I didn’t know what was going on since it is my first build but, after a few minutes I was able to navigate through the bios in order to set up my boot priorities.  ",5,Motherboard
Have had no issues with any connectors and the motherboard hasn't bottlenecked yet. (obviously) ,5,Motherboard
"Cheap motherboard but its all i need, im a little dissapointed there is no SLI support but oh well. ",4,Motherboard

"Could have used more on-board fan headers, but otherwise a solid motherboard with a good UEFI. ",4,Motherboard
"I really like the 5 year warranty, the thermal armor looks down right bad ***.  There are plenty of SATA ports, fan headers, and USB ports and USB headers. I also love the dust covers that come with the board to cover the unused ports and slots on the board and a small dust screen for rear I/O intake assist fan.  Easy to update the BIOS and super stable overclocks.  ",5,Motherboard
Most underrated mobo. Works well and has the sexiest lights on it. ,5,Motherboard
"I don't want to overclock and I don't need any additional mini-PCIe that could come with the H170 Asrock ITX equivalent.
Works perfectly in my SG13 config. Had to turn off the Intel C-State feature on BIOS as it was producing some whiny noise with my i3 6100 but with no impact on CPU performance or rig stability.
Edit: After a week of use and a BIOS update, no more coil whine with C-State on. H110 could have been a better budget choice but out of question because less performance with DMI2 instead of DMI3. ",4,Motherboard
"Only budget DDR3 option I could find that had all of the good stuff. Sata express, i7 support, crossfire support (not planning to sli, so, meh), great audio, and m.2. And not to mention the looks... Great motherboard overall, and I highly recommend. ",5,Motherboard
Went with H170 series rather than Z170 because I won't be overclocking. Good price match to processor. ,4,Motherboard
Works great. Only downside is the fact there are no USB 3.0 headers.  ,4,Motherboard
The dream motherboard. Love how it designed and colored. The Temp-sensor come with board really helps for me to check the water temp. ,5,Motherboard
"Would be perfect if I wasn't forced to RMA it right after buying, top pci slot broken (if you look at my picture you will see the defect inside the slot). The features are great, just the big downside is having to send the motherboard in when my build is finished. ",2,Motherboard
"There is nothing specifically wrong with this MB, but I struggled to get the 24 pin cable plugged in. The plug that it goes into felt somewhat cheap. In contrast, everything else on this MB seems to be of high quality. The heat sinks for example are beautifully made, and I/O Shield is nice and solid. ",4,Motherboard
It works nicely ,5,Motherboard
"Very nice looking board. Doesn't look or feel cheap. BIOS is weak because there is no way to dedicate more memory to the APU. Default is 1GB. I have it updated to the latest version and have searched the internets above and beyond to no avail. Grammar in the BIOS and MSI apps is terrible as it was translated from another language without effort. Front panel connectors had to be connected individually in a very cramped area of the board. Board could have come with an additional PWM header. Also, if possible, they should have placed the CPU socket further away from the PCI-E slot. My GPU card gets hot and this ramps up the cooler on my CPU. Solved this issue by installing a liquid cooler. ",4,Motherboard
"USB 3.0 very fragile, otherwise a great mobo ",4,Motherboard
"Solid mobo, I haven't had any problems with it. Increased my opinion of Gigabyte for sure! ",5,Motherboard
said it can hold 32 GB of ram it can only hold 16 GB other than that everything was as said as well it was easy to build with ,3,Motherboard
"I am very much liking this MOBO, it's got style, 8 SATA ports, supports DDR3-2400RAM, it has two USB ports that support polling rates up to 1000hz. (Great for a gaming mouse and keyboard!) The board also supports up to 64GBs of RAM (WAY more than I will ever need) All in All a very nice board with plenty of room to upgrade. ",5,Motherboard
"I gave this 4 stars because the connectors did not really fit with my case, but that just might be my case. The motherboard was under clocking my CPU and I went through much trouble fixing this. ",4,Motherboard
im still a little hesitant on this motherboard I do like Gigabyte but this seems a little on the cheap side would have preferred a better chipset and more usb ports. The pci slot has a very poor unlock. ,3,Motherboard
"This is a very busy board. It's impressive how much shenanigans Asus has put into a 6.7"" x 6.7"" square: full 8+2 power phasing using quality components, mPCI-E + M.2, a dedicated sound board, plenty of USB ports, and all the fun ROG features you could ever hope for. It's a fantastic foundation for anyone wanting to make a big impression in a small package. I was even luckier to have picked this up as part of a clearance sale, with the only thing wrong being the bent HD Audio headers on the sound card that was very easy to fix. My only caveat was getting it to work properly with the 4790K. At first, Prime95 would cause Windows to crash even on failsafe settings; after updating to the latest BIOS, I was able to push my 4790K to 4.4GHz. ",5,Motherboard
Great board in the price range. The LED is awesome and lots of room for upgrading and additional hard drives. My main complaint for this board is if you are not running a cpu with 40 lanes you can't use the u.2. and if you are running sli you are limited to x16 on card 1 and x8 on card 2. ,4,Motherboard
"A solid motherboard with one of everything. It follows my major expectations and I plan to keep an eye on this series. The Eco mode is something I will likely use the most out of, as my recent build included (or rather lacked) PCI extensions and this board allows you to cut power to what you don’t need to use. With this in mind, it also is slightly oversized and while connecting the 24-pin connector, it bent a little off the side. Just be careful about that; it is easy to bend it. ",4,Motherboard
"No issues with the board, however the owner's manual was written for PhD candidates. ",4,Motherboard
"This motherboard is very good for the price. It has M.2 support, it's sturdy, looks nice, low profile, great BIOS, good surge protection. Though the I/O shield is a joke and makes the motherboard very hard to install, and who puts a fan header in the middle of the motherboard? ",4,Motherboard
"It's a motherboard and has all the features you will probably ever need. 
10/10 would buy again ",5,Motherboard
"Pros:
- Cheap
- Nice BIOS
- Great OC Settings Cons
- Crappy I/O Shield ",3,Motherboard
"I really like this guy. 
Dual BIOSes with a physical switch, plenty of fan headers, and good quality onboard audio. I plug my Grado SR60s into the front headphone jack, and am quite pleased with the audio playback.
This thing has an HDMI in for connecting gaming consoles. I haven't tried too much, but it would be pretty neat if that could be used in a windowed mode. I've only seen full screen as an option, so far. ",4,Motherboard
"I will have to write up a more detailed review once I've utilized some of the overclocking features of this board but as of right now it looks very good, booted right up once I got my PC assembled. It also has a sweet backlit IO panel which is useful if you're plugging in anything in the dark. ",5,Motherboard
GREAT board for $80. The bios is really pretty and easy to undertand for a first time builder like me and ASROCK is probably my go to brand for MoBos for now on. ,5,Motherboard
"Very intuitive UEFI bios as well as being simply astonishing in terms of looks, but I have had trouble when booting. Whenever i boot from completely shutting down the computer, a prompt with ""Overclocking failed!"" comes up and i have to bot from the bios. If anyone has any helpful suggestions, they will be greatly appreciated.  ",4,Motherboard
Great little motherboard. Has worked well the year and a half. ,5,Motherboard
"For the price I would have expected 3.0 headers, but that was a flaw that i hadn't thought of. Will probably upgrade further in the future. ",4,Motherboard
"Absolutely fantastic motherboard for the price, great GUI interface, haven't had any troubles and it colour matches the build perfectly.  ",5,Motherboard
"Pricey I know, but you get what you pay for. My inclination for this board started with the IO, this board is under the 200 dollar threshold that I am not willing to surpass and packs on as many features as it can while looking great. Honestly, I'm not that big a fan of the color scheme, but it is very elegant and works with the modern look of the Fractal Design R5. Honestly, I chose this board for its functionality over it's looks. This is the renaissance man without the crazy bells and whistles associated with the upper price threshold of the Z170 motherboard selection. This board is no Gigabyte Gaming 1 or ASUS Maximus but it is the poor man's version of those boards. It starts with the IO, with many more USB ports than almost any other board on the Z170 platform achieved through ASmedia controllers. Although some purists may complain about latency, I don't give a flying **** because it gets the job done. The only peripherals I need to have zero latency are my keyboard and mouse. Everything else can be laggy as long as transfer speeds are sustained. The back packs on two RJ45 ports that can be teamed using a router that supports it (I have one so don't tell me it's useless) which accelerates transfer speeds to my home server/seedbox. There are 4 USB 3.0 ports, and two USB 2.0 ports (keyboard), and 1 USB 3.1a and 1 USB 3.1c port. In addition to the front connector that adds another 3.1a and 3.1c that's 10 USB PORTS, 10 MOTHER-******! That's more than you're ever going to need! And it packs another two USB 3.0 headers on the board, PREPOSTEROUS! Honestly, the place they source all this IO is voodoo magic. I have a lot of USB devices and this was the main reason I bought this board but there are many more aspects that make this board a steal at the pricepoint. Now the price is essential, I could have bought an ASUS board and I would have the pleasure of dealing with the ASUS BIOS (the best IMO) and the voltage llc graphs in the overlocking utility is a godsend, but alas i had to go with ASrock. The main reason I did this was because ASUS makes you pay the price for having an ASUS board, it's kind of like paying for the name, and at the price point, the boards offered do not match the features of this board. The board has a 12 phase power supply, making overclocking a breeze and everything stays rock solid, ALWAYS, no dips, nothing ever goes wrong. Furthermore the board also packs 3 m.2 slots, which fit my future plans of upgrading to an M.2 SSD raid solution. I'm honestly waiting for the price to drop and the boot time associated with booting off an M.2 ssd to resolve itself. The onboard boot button and reset button are a huge godsend and to be honest having this on the motherboard will make me buy it and the DR DEBUG LEDS HAVE SAVED MY BACON TOO MANY TIMES!  The only issues I faced are the Vcore ramping up automatically sometimes due to the lack of an llc graph and the bios update may have gone bad at one point but that was due to my own lack of precautions when I didn't check the MD5 luckily it didnt brick the chip. The BIOS could use a little work but then again I'm used to Asus BIOS's, which have no comparison. The EZ bios makes it super easy to adjust fan speeds and the fan headers are well placed and plentiful for a mid tower build. This motherboard really is a steal for the price and the color scheme is honestly much more flattering in person. Images don't do the board justice. The accents are actually a copper color, not yellow, and it looks beautiful. ",5,Motherboard
"Basic motherboard for a dead socket. Works at the very least - wish it had more features, and fan connectors. DDR3 is limited to 1333. ",4,Motherboard
"Had a bent CPU socket pin, but seems a good quality board. ",4,Motherboard
"Solid dual Xeon workstation motherboard in the SSI-EEB form factor, supports a ton of RAM and has enough PCIe slots for my purposes. ",5,Motherboard
"The price of an FM2+ board, right? I'd actually say you get a bit more than what you pay for, but not much. Took me a few days to properly understand how to apply settings in BIOS. Apparently you don't need to press the Apply button to apply settings. No idea what that big Apply button is for at all. However, it's the same BIOS for all Gigabyte boards, aside from the top range ones. What I also think it's lacking is SLI support. I had no intention to SLI that 970, until I heard about what Directx12 might be able do to. If it would let me have 3.5+3.5=7GB of VRAM, then a second hand 970 for £200 might be a fairly decent upgrade for this, once DirectX12 is out.
There is an absolutely insane driving issue that this motherboard has. The PWM headers are in the bl**dy middle of the motherboard. Right between the GPU and the Heatsink. Worst place in the world to have any header(aside from CPU fan headers, maybe, just maybe). Took me a good 20 minutes just to connect my two Akasa fans. Another gripe that I have with this motherboard is that I can't find how to regulate the speed for the 3 pin fan header(this one at least is to the side of the motherboard, where it should be). So the two 120mm Fractal case fans that came with the case were running @ 100% until recently, when I got 12v to 6v cables and now they run at 50% all the time. I would rather have it go down, when the temp is low (maybe even off, like the AKASA fans do) and then ramp up, when there's a reason to. I did update the BIOS and I found the fan settings in it, but there's settings only for the two PWM fans and for the CPU fan. The third case fan header goes completely undetected. I do also get pretty bad coil whine through my speakers. Nothing, when the speakers are disconnected, but quite annoying, when I'm playing Far Cry 4. So I was thinking maybe if I get a new motherboard, I won't get coil whine through my speakers/headphones. ",4,Motherboard
"A solid, cheap board for my HTPC. It's been quite reliable. Unfortunately, there is only one SYSFAN header. I also had issues installing both Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 from DVDs in UEFI-only mode (though, I eventually got it to work with a USB install of Windows 10) ",4,Motherboard
I actually bought the non + version. Not sure why PCPP doesn't list that model. Good board. Has a bug where sometimes the UEFI will freeze for no reason but otherwise it's rocking.  The sound on this thing is great! I was going to buy a DAC/AMP but now I'm not sure I need it.  ,4,Motherboard
"Meh... Pros:
-Good surge protection.
-Low profile.
-Good BIOS. Cons:
-Kinda flimsy.
-The I/O shield is a joke, it has all this unnecessary grounding pins which makes the motherboard impossible to install.
-Only one fan header, and it's in the middle of the board. ",3,Motherboard
"Works well. BIOS is a bit crude compared to the 97 series motherboards, but price was right. Major flaw to BIOS: can't turn fans below 60% even when PWM fans are installed and recognized. ",4,Motherboard
Great for the price could be better. ,4,Motherboard
"One of the things that makes this motherboard so good, is a very intelligent PCI-E lane layout. Most X99 motherboards seem to have such an awful lane allocation when using a 28-lane CPU like the 5820K I currently have, wherein PCI-E slots are setup as x16/x0 or even x8/x4 if using multiple GPU's. This, on the other hand, is one of the few that will go to x8/x8 for two-GPU systems. It could do x8/x4/x4 for three-card CF, but that won't be enough for SLI. Still, given my plans to SLI/CF as soon as means allow, this board's layout and design choices are the smartest companion to my 28-lane CPU. Only downer, was that first one I received was DoA, and the second required buying a separate, cheapo stick of RAM to boot the thing long enough to update its BIOS. Otherwise, it's been a solid choice. 4.5/5 ",5,Motherboard
Good value buy for AMD GPU users if you ever plan doing cross fire with dual AMD GPUs   ,4,Motherboard
"Best price for any mobo, ever ($30 when I bought). Doesn't have front panel USB 3.0, but that's because of chipset, not mobo specifically. Also, it seems to not let the RAM run at full frequency, but RAM speed doesn't affect performance that much anyway, and I'm guessing I just didn't look around in the bios carefully enough ",5,Motherboard
"Great motherboard for the price, although it's a shame it doesn't have an M.2 slot ",4,Motherboard

"Basic but good older board with no frills. For a computer made from mostly salvage parts this has been excellent. A good 6 months of bi-daily use and no hiccups. Nothing to write home about, just a steady board. I do wish I'd gotten the one with usb 3.0 headers but I don't need that data transfer speed so an adapter cable at ~$3 more than suffices.

"I got tired of ASUS motherboards, 3 horrible times I tried them 3 times I have had huge issues.. back to good ol Gigabyte, I woudl recommend this board or the gaming 3 even  ",4,Motherboard
"Colors look good, but there's only 2 fan headers (common complaint about most Asrock boards).  ",3,Motherboard
"It has very good sound, very good video, have had now trouble with it but only had for a week so I hop it lasts.    ",5,Motherboard
Looks awesome and the bios gui is really nice. The SATA connectors are under my video card so that presented a bit of an issue. Other than that a really nice MB. ,4,Motherboard
"Not loving this motherboard.  First, it's slightly longer than normal causing it to not fit ideally in standard cases. Secondly, take notice of the first PCI Express slot.  You have to put your video card there and because of how big their SATA mdules are at the end there and their placement, many full size cards cannot fit. Fourth, their first PC Express slow is also very very close to the memory and CPU modules to the point that it's very difficult to fit large video cards in it. Fifth, it doesn't operate until you have a CPU in it.  What I mean by that there is no indication (not even an LED) that the board is working until you place a CPU in it.  Normally, I meticulous test each component as I add it in.  In this case, I had to just rely on faith that the motherboard was fine (it was) until I put the CPU in.  But what if I had had a bad CPU? I wouldn't know if it were the MB or the CPU. ",3,Motherboard
Amazing features for an excellent price. Overclocking and fan profiles are superb. ,5,Motherboard
"Great board, easy to install, simple BIOS interface and easily install-able drivers. ",5,Motherboard
"The BIOS looks nice and is relatively easy to use, however upon booting it makes a loud beep for about 3 seconds, and there is no way to disable it. Also, UEFI makes dual-booting linux a pain (although that is not an issue specific to this motherboard). As far as the actual motherboard goes, it is mostly black with some white highlights and looks quite nice. It's got 2 RAM slots, but only 1 PCIE slot, and also there is only 1 fan power socket on the motherboard, so you can only use 1 extra case fan. ",3,Motherboard
"This is a handsome looking board, understated black, gold and copper. Good connector layout, emphasis on sound quality and did I say it was good looking. ",4,Motherboard
I bought it because it was yellow ,5,Motherboard
"Fairly small, but functional motherboard. It has a bunch of SATA3 headers on the board and 4 USB 3.0 ports which is plently. It doesnt have a lot of room for pci card expansions but it was fine for my build. My only complaint is that there is only 1 system fan header - which I think is odd. I ended up using a PWM fan splitter to power the two case fans. ",4,Motherboard
"Great budget X99 motherboard. Has everything you need but running SLI would be a tight squeeze and then again if you have a WiFi card like I do then its not an option. There are ways around this, but thats the way it is I guess. ",4,Motherboard

"Solid Motherboard. Never had any issues with it since 2012. I hear ASUS is terrible with RMA's and warranty. Gladly, I've never had to deal with them in person. ",5,Motherboard
"Chose this mobo for my semi-budget gaming PC. It was definitely worth the money, albeit it only comes with two SATA cables - both of which I used for my SSD and HDD without issue. However,  this means that if you have a HDD, a SSD and a DVD/CD/BD ROM, you will need an additional SATA cable. CPU was easy to install but the CPU fan was a bit difficult to get in, but I suppose this is down to how good the builder's skill is with fitting things into places. ",5,Motherboard
This Mobo has been a headache for me.  Physically it has performed fine and the BIOS has plenty of editing options for overclocking once you figure out how to use it.  But the Drivers and installed software with this thing is garbage.  The Gigabyte software people should be ashamed.   ,3,Motherboard
The BIOS is very user-friendly. It has a lot of features that are useful for advanced users. ,5,Motherboard
Okay motherboard. Works fine with no problems. ,4,Motherboard
"This motherboard was chosen because of it's excellent reviews, size, and features list. The Gigabyte GA-z97n-WIFI combines good performance and technology with a competitive price.  ",5,Motherboard
"Great motherboard, works very well, has everything I need. Built-in sound card works okay; I bought a sound card because I am a bit of an audiophile. I wish it was a little more spacious, but  I guess that's what I get for getting an ATX. ",4,Motherboard
"Nothing special. I wanted to keep this build cheap and new, so this was one of the cheapest Z97 boards I could find. It also had the USB 3.0 headers I was looking for along with enough SATA connectors. Only reason why this isn't 5 stars is because the IO shield had weird metal tounges hanging out of each connector. (I'm not sure if that is normal or not as this was my first build. ever.) ",4,Motherboard
"The integrated graphics leave a lot to be desired when they work right. (Linux Mint 17 user)
The TDP is 95 watts so please know if you get the 6 core 6300 you will NOT be able to overclock without damaging something because the processor is 95 watts also. And more then 6 core is not possible! Also using a GPU will cover the top 3 sata connections along with the middle slot. ",2,Motherboard
Easy to install. Durable build quality. Built-in features are great. Beautiful design; great for a case with a side window. ,5,Motherboard
My review may be a little biased here because I practically stole the motherboard. It was on sale for $90ish and then there was a $30 rebate on it. Before that brief window of opportunity I was considering an h81 and the like. The only complaint I have about this board is that my GPU (Gigabyte r9 280 windforce) blocks the PCI x1 slot which I would've liked to have been able to use. Other than that it has all the features I could ever need from a board. Looks GREAT w/the thermal armor painted to match your case ,4,Motherboard
"The motherboard originally was part of a package deal from NewEgg when I was building my computer and recommended this. I did some reviews of it on Guru3d before making my final decision, I still feel like I got the wrong board. Apparently reviews were all 50/50 with this piece. Some people said it was a great board, others complained about issues with the bios, there have been times where the cmos just randomly resets itself over the years and I have to go in and fix my boot configuration. But for the most part it's been a stable piece of equipment. 
It really didn't handle crossfire gaming too well, I ran to 5770's from ati on it and constantly got blue screens. I eventually wanted to return to dual card configs or have that flexibility, but with the video card I have in the computer now, I don't think there is any way this could possibly handle another 980ti, much less could the processor.  So many better options available at the time, I just ran what was convenient. This still is bottlenecked and doesn't have usb 3.1 only a few usb 2.0 spots, subpar onboard audio, really isn't a powerhouse, but it's stable.  ",3,Motherboard
"Business-grade mobo from Asus, meaning stability and durability. No problems with this whatsoever. Also offers overclocking, but not a huge plethora of options for it. ",4,Motherboard
"Awesome Mobo. After buying it i saw in the BIOS that both Graphics cards run at PCIe 16x, the 5820k has 28 lanes, what? Afterwards i found out it has PLX which adds another 24 Lanes to your System -  means in quad GPU with a 40 Lane CPU - Every GPU runs at PCIe16x :) ",5,Motherboard
"Now This Motherboard Was A ""Quick Need"" Because My Previous Motherboard (ASRock 970 Pro 3 R2.0) Would Always Throttle On Stock Speeds, Anyways This Board Gets The Job Done And Looks Good At The Same Time ",5,Motherboard
"Audio is nice and their BIOS was easy to navigate, plus it just looks great. Would buy again. ",5,Motherboard
The layout of the board is what surprised me most. Fan headers were within reach for every fan with enough slack for tie-downs. PCI-e slots are plentiful with a nice mix for old PCI added in between. Power delivery seems very efficient as my 4690K could only OC to 4.0Ghz 1.025v on an old Biostar while this got me to 4.2Ghz at 1.025v. Motherboard PCB is a dark brown color that is noticeable from the underside but looks black towards the front. It also supports two newer techs. M.2 and eSATA. I was looking forward to trying out PCI-based M.2 but SATA based modules work extremely well and can really help with cable management if you're into that. This board also supports hot-swap though it must be enabled in the UEFI. ,5,Motherboard
"I got this board for free as part of a package deal with my 7850k and after a MIR from Micro Center.  Just the fact that it works get it 5 stars.  If I had to pay full price though, I'll probably spend the extra $10 for an A88x board.  This board is only capable of light OC'ing and has limited ports/slots.  Also, there is only 1 fan header, so you'll probably need a splitter.  If you're a casual gamer and not planning on doing an OC, this board is more than serviceable.   ",5,Motherboard
"Good looking board easy to work with for it's size. MSI has an easy to use bios, there are only a few issues. If you plan on uesing dual graphics cards then you will not be able to use the middle slot also lacking on fan connectors. Wish we could get rid of VGA ports and add a display port.  ",4,Motherboard
"Got this Mobo for $60 on Cyber Monday, it took to restarts for the Bios to open but haven't had trouble since then ",4,Motherboard
Has All the component for future upgrades. Ultra Durable for real.  ,5,Motherboard
Great if it suites your needs and does everything as advertised.  ,5,Motherboard
"Quality and convenience is how I would describe the Sabertooth Mk2. Every part of the mobo feels solid, like really solid. It's not cheap, but at least you can touch and see where the $ went. The other benefit of spending a bit more is getting all the ports/headers positioned exactly where you'd want them to be. Right angle SATA ports, fan headers in numerous locations, choice of USB2/3 connectors, to name a few. The only omission I can think of is M.2. However this is still in its infancy, and I'm more than happy with the boot up times from my SSD. As a beginner, I found the UEFI BIOS extremely easy to use. If you are a pro, then it would have everything you need. ",5,Motherboard

"It's very delicate (I broke the Turbo 3D thing while installing the cooler).
Also, It support 32GB RAM, not 16, And HAS USB 3.0 on I/O, no header for the case though. ",3,Motherboard
"Never had a problem with this board. Offers plenty of extra software (most of which I don't use but it's nice to have available for some people). Offers a CPU overclock button right on motherboard for small, safe boost in CPU clock multipliers. ",5,Motherboard
"Good mobo, would suggest not installing any of the xFast utilities from the motherboard's support CD, it can cause some fit's for external hard drives on your front panel. ",3,Motherboard
"This board was actually not the original I intended to get. After some thought, since I'm never going to be doing dual vid cards or have a ton of expansion cards, no need for anything bigger. Fit perfectly, no issues with mounting or adding components to it. Well built and strong. Price tag of $45 after mail-in helps as well. ",5,Motherboard
An exceptional board if you can find one; durable and easily with the best layout and headers I've seen in years. ,4,Motherboard
"No complaints here. Board stays cool, boots up smoothly and has more features than I know what to do with. Have not done any overclocking but I am sure this board will have zero issues with overclocking the 4790K.  ",5,Motherboard
"Really annoying motherboard, has a sticker stuck to back of CPU mount on every single board I recived, that leaves residue needing to be cleaned with isopropyl rubbing alcohol. It does work however (obviously), with a nice selection of ports, and an AMAZING price. Also  ",3,Motherboard
"Great beginner building board. Doesn't have all the features that premium boards have, but this board has M.2 and supports overclocking as well as crossfire. I would've liked to see this board support SLI.  ",4,Motherboard

"Great board, looks very nice, works. ",4,Motherboard
"Pros: Easy to overclock once setup lots of bells and whistles, most of which are completely irrelevant.  Cons: I made the n00b mistake of assuming that the ""raid"" controller was a hardware raid controller (which I naively assumed was better). It isn't, and the entire marketing of ""raid"" features on most consumer motherboards are just garbage. Either use a real raid controller or setup software raid. may the good lord help you if you aren't running Windows or if you want to deal with getting updates over the internet (a feature they offer but I was never able to get work) ",3,Motherboard
"This motherboard has a lot of top-end features, but its lack of pedestrian features can be a pain. No USB2.0 headers made it hard to make the CPU cooler and the WiFi card work, as most peripheral manufacturers assume there is a USB2.0 header available.) No Bluetooth or WiFi is fairly standard for gaming rigs, but realistically I only have this one desktop and I need to be able to pair my bluetooth stuff with it, and sometimes you are not in a tournament and using WiFi would be easiest. (Obviously I knew it didn't have those features when I bougt it, but now that the WiFi PCI-E card I got won't work without an adapter, I'm annoyed.) Also make sure your case will fit EATX, this thing is big! ",4,Motherboard
"Nice Bios, but flimsy sata ports, a bit warped out of the box. Ram slots are too close to the CPU to fit a proper cooler, make sure your heatsink brackets will fit before hand. I had to snap off a side of the bracket to be able to fit 2 ram sticks. ",4,Motherboard
"This one's interesting. I've found that it's VERY often the cheapest mobo for Haswell CPUs, often dipping below $30, and it even has a B85 chipset (which is technically not the lowest end one). Although I got it working in the end, it's a bit weird: At first, it would randomly shut off after about 10 minutes of use, whether that was in the BIOS, installing Windows, or whatever. Then, I checked the CPU support list, and the G3258 (and most other Haswell Pentiums) were not there. I managed to fix things by enabling the ""overclocking lock"" and disabling ""unlock CPU voltage"" in the BIOS, but still, strange. And no official support for most Pentiums. Additionally, the layout is a bit non-standard, with the front panel headers above the PCIe lane ",3,Motherboard
Great features and boots very quickly. Integrated AC wireless is awesome. The all black color scheme is really cool too. ,4,Motherboard
Suited my needs quite well. ,5,Motherboard
"I love this motherboard. Everything about it is just A+. And although this is secondary; the overall look of it... it's just eye-melting. I was looking at it in the box days before I even started building with it. But as for features, I wanted a lot of USB ports because I was sick of only having 1 USB 3.0 port on my laptop. With 2 USB 2.0, 6 USB 3.0, AND 2 USB 3.1 ports, this thing will surely have enough for whatever devices I ever need to plug in all together. Another selling point for this is the fantastic onboard audio. I wasn't interested in getting a sound card... so this was great. Every review I read said that it was very good, and I do agree now that I have it. Everything sounds crisp and clear, especially using my Razer Leviathan soundbar (I'm a slight Razer fanboy but I do understand that they have their faults, overpriced products being one of them.) But I digress. Overclocking is good, I haven't done much but it seems to be very stable, and the BIOS is pretty easy to navigate and has a lot of cool features like Board Explorer and an easy to use fan speed controller. Unfortunately I'm not able to adjust my front CPU fans through the BIOS as they are plugged into the splitter on the NZXT Kraken. This just means I have to use the CAM software to do it. One thing that I really liked, though - the IO shield is padded and has absolutely no sharp edges. It was a breeze to put in; like installing a little pillow into the case. And it is colored black on both sides to match the case as well. A+, 5 stars, 8/8 gr8. ",5,Motherboard
"Works perfectly fine. Holding an 4.5 GHz overclock on a 4690k with 1.2V. Wifi range is very good (at least compared to a surface pro 2 and a lenovo laptop). On the cheaper side compared to other Z97 ITX boards. Looks good with its black and blue color scheme. 4 stars, because in my specific application, there were some clearance issues with the H100i and Corsair 250D. The WiFi antenna is tough to tighten without tools. ",4,Motherboard
Last 2 slots are never going to be filled with cards. 5/5 ,5,Motherboard

"Great board, just cant hit the reset button or else apparently it locks up. I don't want to try ",4,Motherboard
"Great BIOS, no bugs at all, the only thing that I have with it is that the VRMs don't have a heatsink on them, so I don't want to overclock the CPU. ",4,Motherboard
"It has allowed me for to get up to 4.6ghz with my A8 6600K, the things that hold the stock cooler on were really hard to remove. It has 10 power phases which is nice for overclocking and it has a neutral color to it. ",5,Motherboard
SLI & Crossfire support. Great motherboard. Has a lot of features including OC Genie. Got this for $10! What more could I ask for? ,5,Motherboard
"This motherboard is pretty average, and it's good for a more budget build as it's not overly expensive because of the ""gamer"" theme. They do have a version with wi-fi but it's more expensive, and you can get a USB adapter for like $5. As usual, ASUS' BIOS is superb. ",5,Motherboard
This is the easy button of motherboards! But if you don't care much about built-in Wifi and Bluetooth you can get the regular Asus Z97 Pro for less money. ,5,Motherboard
"A good OC board with dualbios, not the best but its enough. The Bios software could be better. ",4,Motherboard
"Mobo with SLI support, has all the bells and whistles. The only thing i wish i had was the hard drive hot swapping, but i will live. it looks nice, and it very easy to use. Bios is very easy to use, and it is very easy to troubleshoot. Has a cmos reset button, which comes in handy Edit, Had to remove a star. Ethernet port sometimes just doesn't work and i have to use a ethernet card to get wireless now. Also the ram slots are fragile, I accidentally had my watercooler pushing it a little when i tried putting it in, and one of the slots broke. :( Edit as of 3/26/16, On startup the board gives the error code of missing OS, but when i shut down the computer and switch the dvi connection on my video card, it works just fine for about a week and then starts to do the same thing. Im not sure if its my graphics card, or if its my motherboard, but im mostly sure it is my motherboard as my video card does not do this in any other rig ",4,Motherboard
"Ok. It only supports 4gb of ddr2 RAM, sadly. ",3,Motherboard
"I purchased this not knowing what to expect given it's price point and lack of reviews but I am thoroughly impressed with it as a budget Z170 board. The board itself is a simple black/grey color scheme which fits in aesthetically with most cases and parts. One really unique feature is the level of LED customization that has blown me away. The utility software packaged with the board is easy to use and needs to be left running minimized in the system tray to turn the LEDs on. They can be set to any RGB color with the LED locations being on the motherboard heatsinks and along the outside edge of the PCI expansion slots. The board also comes with a flexible LED light strip and a specialized LED header near the CPU fan headers which can also be controlled by the software. The BIOS was easy to use and picked up everything right out of the box with no issues, the only setting that took a moment to find was adjusting the boot order to put my SSD ahead of the HDD. Driver CD did what it was supposed to and I was up and running with Windows 7 in under 20 minutes from CD install. The utilities software is worth the install too not just for the LED control but also for the Hardware Monitor. This is a great board for those who are looking to have something that matches their components if following an aesthetic theme. On top of that I had no issues with installs and the BIOS out of the box worked as expected.  ",5,Motherboard
Nice mobo loving the bios especially when coming from a h110. Looks great to ,5,Motherboard
"Nothing's wrong out of the box, good price for the features that you get. ",5,Motherboard
"Software is meh, fan control is just downright WTF, and the X boost BSODs my computer. It's fine overall and has a Realtek 150meg nic integrated so that's nice. For $50 look no further if you want a decent OC and pretty good looks. I was kinda hard on it because I came from an MSI board with OC Genie, command center, and a killer nic and this board, software wise, is a step down.  ",4,Motherboard
"A pretty straight forward board with a really good UEFI interface and solid overclocking options.  I'd give it higher marks, but the Micro ATX format is quite limited and the board didn't want to actually fit well in the case I bought. ",3,Motherboard
"sata ports are glitchy, sometimes won't recognise hard drives, maybe its the hard drives , who knows ",3,Motherboard
Great looking MOBO that matched my color design and has plenty of ports on it. I like it a lot and it loads very quickly with a nicely designed BIOS.  ,5,Motherboard
"I went with this board for two reasons.  1) It was build with super high rated capacitors and heat tolerant components that will increase its life time 100 fold. (ASUS is known for their reliability, I have an ASUS ROG from 2006 that is still kicking ***) 2) Its aesthetics. Man this thing looks clean with its thermal armor. I really wish that ASUS would come out with thermal armor upgrades for all of their boards.  Things to note: this would not have been my first choice board. I'm not a big fan of the camo theme, but luckily most of that gets covered up in my build anyways. I like the maximums series but red did not work for this build. Also this board is a little more difficult to OC the RAM, it was very easy to do with the asus z97 pro + wifi (the board I bought at first) Also the AI suite was a little better with the z97 pro as well. But overall the board functions fantastically. You can't go wrong and its a very good price.  ",4,Motherboard

It's $10 after the $40 Micro Center combo discount and $30 MIR. $100 total and I got an upgrade that costs only as much as an i3 by itself. The actual board? I have absolutely no complaints about it. Others may hate the red, but I don't really mind it. This board comes with 2 CPU fan headers and 4 system fan headers (CPU1, SYS2 and SYS4 headers are all PWM, the others are 3pin headers). It supports the 9590 and 9370 (if for some reason you wanted to do that). ",5,Motherboard

I had an issue with the bluetooth / WiFi module as well as bent CPU socket pins; the manufacturer repaired this at no cost to me. In the future I'll keep in mind at least a couple extra fan headers and at least 1 extra PCI Express for SSD expansion. Other than that I love this board. ,4,Motherboard

"Decent mobo, but the positioning of CPU slot and the transistors around it limits the CPU coolers you can choose from. 
OC is limited to 4.3Ghz for the i7 3770k as 4.4Ghz effectively crashes your system
Fan control is very limited and the Gigabyte App Center crashes the Win 10 system, effectively meaning there is no support for this mobo anymore from Gigabyte.
Good thing about it is the Bios recovery which can be a life saver, especially when you play around with overclocking ( talking from experience haha ). Also it is very easy to update the Bios and the 3D display of the Bios interface makes it easier for people that are  not sure of how to safely clock or change other settings.  ",3,Motherboard
"Very good, full of features and ports the only problem is not with the actual motherboard with the AMD chipset that doesn't support PCIe gen 3 which kinda sucks ",4,Motherboard
I love this motherboard as it comes with a lot of ports in the back for all your perfiethelas which is great. It is also a very nice looking motherboard and goes well with my military theme. It comes with 5 Fan ports which is great so my setup stays nice and cool. It has an internal fan which you can add if you wish so the closed parts of the motherboard stay cooled as well. ,5,Motherboard
"Great motherboard, no complaints. I got to support my thunderbolt display.  ",5,Motherboard
"Good build quality and good for overclocks, haven't  had a single problem with it. ",5,Motherboard
"Asus made a great budget motherboard. There's no included wireless adapter, so keep that in mind. I knew this going in, though, and don't need wireless. ",5,Motherboard
This Motherboard is amazing because it supports 7.1 speakers and has awesome dual Ethernet ports that support internet teaming for fast internet speeds. This motherboard has lots of USB ports most of the ports are USB 3.0 there is some USB 2.0 plus this motherboard has a m.2 slot. and it overclocks  vary nicely. ,4,Motherboard
"Cheap, works, small, it fits nice in small cases and it doesnt look that bad really.
I just wish it had more fan headers, has one, plus the cpu fan. so 2 total ",4,Motherboard
Worked and overclocked nice ,5,Motherboard
A very basic mobo with basic features. No onboard USB 3.0 headers. Had to use an adapter so the USB 3.0 ports on the side of the case can be used as USB 2.0. A single large capacitor sits in the way of the NH-L9i. Can be bent out of the way. Later Edit: Turns out there is a DVI version of this mobo that is identical but features onboard USB 3.0 headers.  ,3,Motherboard
"Best mobo I have ever used. Asus suit 3, actually is useful for once. This board is also great for overclocking the FM2+ line. However, the normal heat monitors HWmonitor, Speccy, Coretemp do not accurately read the cpu temps?? So I just use the bios. Bios flashback was useful as I had to update the bios for the 860k ",5,Motherboard
"I took down stars because of ASRocks quality control. My first board had many physical flaws, and was dead. My second was flawless, and I would give that board an 11/10. Just frustrated that the first board was faulty. ",3,Motherboard
"Many motherboards seem to come with bright colours so I was glad when I set eyes on the more subtle black gold of the ASRockZ170  Extreme4+  A Bios/UEFI update on first install was needed in order to see the full features as seen in many reviews (manufacturers shipped many Z170 boards out very quickly due to Intel demands, and updated Bios software followed shortly after)
This board has great overclocking potential, the finer settings when needed are there, as well as the quick settings which work well to start with. It has been stable even when overclocking a little to much, and the featured on-board manual reset switch works well if needed (if resetting the board it remembers any profiles that have been saved)  The on-board sound turned out to be much better than expected, giving a surprisingly clear sound. The built in USB 3.1 ports are welcome. I decided not to use the extra front USB panel provided with the + package due to the fact that it will use 2 entire SATA ports and a USB header in order to operate, the USB headers are already allocated to front casing USB ports and CPU cooler control on this build. Ram XMP profiles worked straight away with the Corsair LPX and HDD were easy to allocate to 6Gbs speeds. Recommended. ",4,Motherboard
Really the only reason I got this board was for the insane deal I got on it. $70 for X99? Count me in. I havent had an problems with it although the lighting is a bit more yellow than the rest of the gold accents which makes it kind of ugly. I just shut that off in the BIOS tho so I'm not complaining considering the price.  ,4,Motherboard
great for my case and the bios are awesome this thing is just all around awesome highly recommended. ,5,Motherboard
Motherboard performs awesome and looks amazing with the Armor on it! ,5,Motherboard
I wish I went bigger but it does the job. ,4,Motherboard
It label places like Usb on it. +1 ,5,Motherboard
Excellent customer support and driver availability! ,5,Motherboard
"I haven't built a pc in 9-10 years and damn! this mobo feels so solid. it looks so good. personally i don't need to see my parts but for someone who does, this thing looks sweet. It is a bit much for this build, seeing as i'm not going to overclock, but better to have more than to have less. ",5,Motherboard
"Great motherboard, easy to set up, comes with wifi, nice audio, plenty of input and the bios was easy to get used to. It recognized my optical drive straight away and booted windows from it with no issue. Only issue I had was it only has two 4pin fan connectors, and I needed 4. Molex to the rescue. ",4,Motherboard
"This motherboard is great, it has the best BIOS Ive ever used so far. It looks great, the layout if it is pretty good. Only thing that bugs me is it has three fan headers, but only one doesn't run three pin fans at full speed, to use the other two effectively, you'll need four pin fans. ",5,Motherboard
"Another good investment, easy to set up (hardware, drivers, and bios) and it's sturdy. Doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Easy to find everything (bios and hardware) and recognised everything. ",5,Motherboard
Had to do a BIOS update borrowing a friend's 2nd generation i5 to version F10 before I could use my i7-3770k... the top PCI-E x1 port has a really annoyingly tall heatsink which prevented me from using my Visiontek KillerNic 2100 until I bought off eBay a PCI-E x1 extension cable (as pictured above) to make it work... it was a package deal I got off a bud hence the price. ,3,Motherboard
Little tricky to get working but once it got working it has been completely rock solid ,4,Motherboard
"It's a motherboard, was cheap, ASRock high quality, mostly black, full sized ATX, and doesn't come with bloatware (You have to manually download and install their apps). I would go with a more expensive board if someone is looking to do heavy overclocking and wants more of a futureproof build. ",4,Motherboard
"Only con is that the SYS_FAN2 connector seems to not be fully functioning. On the other hand, the connectors are placed in logical places, the UEFI BIOS is both gorgeous and easy to use, and the board itself feels like it is good quality. GIGABYTE has earned my trust. ",4,Motherboard
"Worked just fine, no problems with it after 3 years.  ",5,Motherboard
"Really nice, got it for super cheap. I love the Thermal Armor and back-plate, however the little fans can get loud. ",5,Motherboard
"Fantastic quality and appearance, and got it for a great price. ",5,Motherboard
its an okay motherboard but the only downsite is that there are only 2 fan header so i had to put my front fan in molex and its running full load constant but still quiet and then my system will never overheat ,4,Motherboard
"Any motherboards with mSATA slots are the best motherboards in my opinion, love the click BIOS for MSI and also love the OC Genie for someone like me who doesn't care to do manual overclocks. ",5,Motherboard
"Great board with lots of features! First was a dud due to bad A dimm slots. RMAed and got a second one, works great! Highly recommend! ",5,Motherboard
Great MB for gaming with a badass look and design. I love how nice this motherboard looks and comes with an incrediable amount of features on the driver CD. The SupremeFX sound card that comes with sends out amazing quality to my 5.1 sound system. I wish it could take DDR4 and had the Republic of Gamers logo in a different spot because SLI graphics card block it.  ,4,Motherboard
"MY theme is BLACK & RED , & i was impressed by the Dragon themed by msi .a Z97mobo was damn pricey, and it was not to much of an upgraded version on an z87 chipset, so at $100 dragon themed mobo,mSI g87 g43, was a really nice bargain for me.   ",5,Motherboard
"I love how i can charge my iPod and portable charger while the computer is off!!! Plus i liked how it came with 2 SATA3 Cables which was exactly enough for my SSD and Hard Drive, Although it would have been nice to have a 3rd cable in case i wanted to install a DVD Drive the 2 cables Where Fine!!!! ",5,Motherboard
"Love it so far,love the way the UEFI looks.
Its working so far. ",5,Motherboard
"Exceptional Value for money if you are currently in the UK. Has Overclocking support, comes with built in WiFi and has all the standard features of good Motherboards such as HDMI for Integrated graphics, USB 3.0 etc. It does only come with 4 Sata Ports though, so storage may be limited. For less than £50 you cannot get much better than this. Just make sure BIOS is on at least version 1.6, as earlier versions had issues when restarting and shutting down the PC. Same applies if you intend to use Haswell Refresh CPUs. ",5,Motherboard
"Has every kind of connectivity I could hope with more to spare. Has yet to cause any issues operating any of my components. Only thing I would have liked would be more fan headers, though 4 has been working fine for me so far. ",5,Motherboard
"Good motherboard, good price, great on board audio (ALC1150). Wifi is average, but the lack of fan headers kinda bugged me. Not too big of a problem in my case since it had a fan splitter. Also, the placement of the headers/connectors were kinda problematic for me. Not the smartest board layout IMO, especially considering where the 8-pin CPU connector was. I had to bend that cable all sorts of ways to keep it from getting caught by my fans. The first time I put everything together in the case after it posted, the computer hung on ""getting devices ready."" I rebooted, and I got a screen which said ""your computer did not boot properly. This might be due to a recent hardware change. Please insert your Windows Installation disc and select 'Repair My Operating System'"" or something along the lines of that. I did just that and for some reason it booted just fine afterwards but hung again on getting devices ready. I tried one more time and my computer finally booted but for some reason Windows was bugging the hell out. Recycle bin was gone, lost the ability to put my computer to sleep, among other things. I assumed it had to do with conflicting drivers since I switched from an ASUS board to an ASRock board, and I ended up just formatting my SSD (which caused the computer to freeze, but a reboot fixed the job). Everything works fine as intended now. ",4,Motherboard
"A seriously amazing MOBO, so happy that I went with this board.  The reset, CMOS, power button, and LED display really helped me through the initial startup, and makes it so incredibly easy to make changes and fix errors.  Not to mention the longer warranty of 5-years compared to the standard 3-year, AND the 178 hours of testing these boards go through at Gigabyte's server center in Taiwan before even being shipped out for sale to ensure quality.  An amazing beyond amazing board, prompting me to forever be a Gigabyte fan. ",5,Motherboard
"Pretty Good for a cheap Motherboard. I use Biostar H61MHV, there wasn't any selection of motherboards for this model. So I just chose H61MHB. ",4,Motherboard
Has almost everything that I need. Great overclocking features for the price. I only wish that it had 3 case fan headers instead of 2 case fan and 2 cpu fan headers. ,5,Motherboard
Very Nice Feature packed board with great potential for over clocking ,5,Motherboard
"Sweet board that could overclock the cpu, and had a front usb 3.0 connector which was good for its price.  ",5,Motherboard
Got a backplate for a z97 motherboard with it....  ,4,Motherboard
works well but the 24 power connector is located at the top rather than the right side of the mobo which killed cable management for me. ,3,Motherboard
"A fantastic board, the only original part from the eBay PC. The price was calculated from the difference between how much each part was sold for and the price of the PC. ",5,Motherboard
"BIOS is easy to use and have not had any issues with it. Wish there was a DVI port and a 3.0 header, but you get what you pay for. ",4,Motherboard
"This is the first ASRock mobo I built with, I've always used ASUS. I couldn't be more pleased with the quality and BIOS. Really great mobo with the bells and whistles for the price. ",5,Motherboard
All those ridiculous features make this a pretty nice motherboard. ,5,Motherboard
"This has been a great motherboard for me. It is extremely easy for me to overclock the CPU, and it has been 100% stable for years. The GUI is adequate. I got it to support SLI, though after my previous experience I may stick to more powerful single cards for now. ",5,Motherboard
This motherboard was the perfect balance between features and price for me.  It is based on the H87 platform rather that the cheaper and less feature rich B85 and H81 platforms.  It accepted the Haswell Refresh CPU without needing a BIOS update. ,5,Motherboard
"The only thing I would add is that its a little small as seen in the pics. But thats not the products fault, as I choose it. But other than that it does its job with no issues. ",4,Motherboard
Has a lot of cool features was confusing at first for a 1st time builder but did research and now i know my way around it.  Its a great motherboard. ,4,Motherboard
"[NEW] The mainboard was bought to fit my desired case so I had to go mATX which I never regretted until now. Since my CPU is Non-K, I had no real need for a Z-series mainboard but it was a good price for a very good equipped board ... plus it is Black/Gold which looks awesome ;) ",5,Motherboard
"I don't want to overclock and I don't need any additional mini-PCIe that could come with the H170 Asrock ITX equivalent.
Works perfectly in my SG13 config. Had to turn off the Intel C-State feature on BIOS as it was producing some whiny noise with my i3 6100 but with no impact on CPU performance or rig stability.
Edit: After a week of use and a BIOS update, no more coil whine with C-State on. H110 could have been a better budget choice but out of question because less performance with DMI2 instead of DMI3. ",4,Motherboard

"This is a great motherboard with plenty of SATA ports, and enough fan inputs for my tastes. The bios is nice and simple, and very easy to use with the i5 2500k. ",5,Motherboard
RAM slots run into GPU and is nearly impossible to work around where the wire slots are for certain things.  ,2,Motherboard
"Just like any other mobo, this one was fine. Except I would not reccomed this to anyone. ",3,Motherboard
"Basic motherboard, does what's supposed to do. Doesn't have neither USB 3.0 nor Sata III support, but at the time those were not that common, so it's fine. ",3,Motherboard
"An almost-Mini-ITX motherboard (174mm x 225mm) that's both cheap and full-featured. Assuming the two PCIe slots are taken up by a graphics card, the ""extra"" PCI slot is most useful for adding a wireless internet connection. Includes USB 3.0, HD Audio and four 6Gb/s SATA ports. ",4,Motherboard
"Looks awesome, supports fast RAM and overclocked processors, otherwise performs like any other mobo. ",3,Motherboard
